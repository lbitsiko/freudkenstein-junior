In the following pages, 
I shall demonstrate that there is a 
psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, 
and that on the application of this technique, 
every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, 
full of significance, 
and one which may be assigned to a specific place in 
the psychic activities of the waking state.
Further, 
I shall endeavor to elucidate the processes which underlie the strangeness 
and obscurity of dreams, 
and to deduce from these processes the 
nature of the psychic forces whose conflict or co-operation is responsible for our dreams.
This done, 
my investigation will terminate, 
as it will have reached the point where the problem of 
the dream merges into more comprehensive problems, 
and to solve these, 
we must have recourse to material of a different kind.
 

I shall begin by giving a short account of the views of earlier 
writers on this subject and of the status of the dream-problem 
in contemporary science;
since in the course of this treatise, 
I shall not often have occasion to refer to either.
In spite of thousands of years of endeavor, 
little progress has been made in the 
scientific understanding of dreams.
This fact has been so universally acknowledged by previous writers on the subject that it 
seems hardly necessary to quote individual opinions.
The reader 
will find, 
in many stimulating observations, 
and plenty of interesting material relating to our subject, 
but little or nothing that 
concerns the true nature of the dream, 
or that solves definitely any of its enigmas.

The educated layman, 
of course, 
knows even 
less of the matter.
 

The conception of the dream that was held in prehistoric ages 
by primitive peoples, 
and the influence which it may have exerted on the formation of their conceptions of the universe, 
and of the soul, 
is a theme of such great interest that it is only with 
reluctance that I refrain from dealing with it in these pages.
I will refer the reader to the well-known works of Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury), 
Herbert Spencer, 
E.
B.
Tylor and other 
writers;
I will only add that we shall not realize the importance 
of these problems and speculations until we have completed 
the task of dream interpretation that lies before us.
 

A reminiscence of the concept of the dream that was held in 
primitive times seems to underlie the evaluation of the dream 
which was current among the peoples of classical antiquity .
 1 
They took it for granted that dreams were related to the world 
of the supernatural beings in whom they believed, 
and that they brought inspirations from the gods and demons.
Moreover, 
it appeared to them that dreams must serve a special purpose in 
respect of the dreamer;
that, 
as a rule, 
they predicted the future.
 
The extraordinary variations in the content of dreams, 
and in the impressions which they produced on the dreamer, 
made it, 
of course, 
very difficult to formulate a coherent conception of them, 
and necessitated manifold differentiations and group-formations, 
according to their value and reliability.

The valuation of dreams 
by the individual philosophers of antiquity naturally depended 
on the importance which they were prepared to attribute to 
manticism in general.
 

In the two works of Aristotle in which there is mention of 
dreams, 
they are already regarded as constituting a problem of 
psychology.

We are told that the dream is not god-sent, 
that 
it is not of divine but of daimonic origin.

For nature is really 
daimonic, 
not divine;
that is to say, 
the dream is not a supernatural revelation, 
but is subject to the laws of the human spirit,  
which has, 
of course, 
a kinship with the divine.

The dream is 
defined as the psychic activity of the sleeper, 
inasmuch as he is 
asleep.

Aristotle was acquainted with some of the characteristics 
of the dream-life;
for example, 
he knew that a dream converts 
the slight sensations perceived in sleep into intense sensations 
(one imagines that one is walking through fire, 
and feels hot,  
if this or that part of the body becomes only quite slightly 
warm), 
which led him to conclude that dreams might easily 
betray to the physician the first indications of an incipient physical change which escaped observation during the day. 

As has been said, 
those writers of antiquity who preceded 
Aristotle did not regard the dream as a product of the dreaming 
psyche, 
but as an inspiration of divine origin, 
and in ancient times, 
the two opposing tendencies which we shall find throughout the ages in respect of the evaluation of the dream-life, 
were already perceptible.

The ancients distinguished between the 
true and valuable dreams which were sent to the dreamer as 
warnings, 
or to foretell future events, 
and the vain, 
fraudulent 
and empty dreams, 
whose object was to misguide him or lead him 
to destruction.
 

The pre-scientific conception of the dream which obtained 
among the ancients was, 
of course, 
in perfect keeping with their 
general conception of the universe, 
which was accustomed to 
project as an external reality that which possessed reality only 
in the life of the psyche.

Further, 
it accounted for the main impression made upon the waking life by the morning memory 
of the dream;
for in this memory the dream, 
as compared with the rest of the psychic content, 
seems to be something alien, 
coming, 
as it were, 
from another world.
It would be an error to 
suppose that the theory of the supernatural origin of dreams 
lacks followers even in our own times;
for quite apart from 
pietistic and mystical writers — who cling, 
as they are perfectly justified in doing, 
to the remnants of the once predominant realm of the supernatural until these remnants have been swept 
away by scientific explanation — we not infrequently find that 
quite intelligent persons, 
 who in other respects are averse to 
anything of a romantic nature, 
 go so far as to base their religious 
belief in the existence and co-operation of superhuman spiritual 
powers on the inexplicable nature of the phenomena of dreams (Haffner).

The validity ascribed to the dream life by certain 
schools of philosophy — 
for example, 
by the school of Schelling — 
is a distinct reminiscence of the undisputed belief in the divinity 
of dreams which prevailed in antiquity;
and for some thinkers, 
the mantic or prophetic power of dreams is still a subject of debate.

This is due to the fact that the explanations attempted 
by psychology are too inadequate to cope with the accumulated material, 
however strongly the scientific thinker may feel that 
such superstitious doctrines should be repudiated.
 

To write a history of our scientific knowledge of the dream 
problem is extremely difficult, 
because, 
valuable though this knowledge may be in certain respects, 
no real progress in a definite direction is as yet discernible.
No real foundation of verified results has hitherto been established on which future investigators might continue to build.

Every new author approaches 
the same problems afresh, 
and from the very beginning.
If I were to enumerate such authors in chronological order, 
giving a survey of the opinions which each has held concerning the problems of the dream, 
I should be quite unable to draw a clear and 
complete picture of the present state of our knowledge on the 
subject.

I have therefore preferred to base my method of treatment on themes rather than on authors, 
and in attempting the solution of each problem of the dream, 
I shall cite the material found in the literature of the subject.
 
But as I have not succeeded in mastering the whole of this literature —
for it is widely dispersed and interwoven with the literature of other subjects —
I must ask my readers to rest content 
with my survey as it stands, 
provided that no fundamental fact 
or important point of view has been overlooked.
 

In a supplement to a later German edition, 
the author adds: 
I shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary 
of the literature of dream problems to cover the period between 
first appearance of this book and the publication of the second 
edition.

This justification may not seem very satisfactory to the reader;
none the less, 
to me it was decisive.

The motives which 
induced me to summarize the treatment of dreams in the literature 
of the subject have been exhausted by the foregoing introduction;
to have continued this would have cost me a great deal 
of effort and would not have been particularly useful or instructive.

For the interval in question —
a period of nine years —
has yielded nothing new or valuable as regards the conception of dreams, 
either in actual material or in novel points of view.
In most of the literature which has appeared since the publication of my own work, 
the latter has not been mentioned or discussed; 
it has, 
of course, 
received the least attention from the so-called 
research workers on dreams, 
who have thus afforded a brilliant example of the aversion to learning anything new so characteristic of the scientist.

Les savants ne sont pas curieux, 
said the scoffer, 
Anatole France.

If there were such a thing in 
science as the right of revenge, 
I, 
in my turn, 
should be justified 
in ignoring the literature which has appeared since the publication of this book.

The few reviews which have appeared in the 
scientific journals are so full of misconceptions and lack of comprehension that my only possible answer to my critics would be 
a request that they should read this book over again — or perhaps 
merely that they should read it I 

And in a supplement to the fourth German edition which appeared in 1914, 
a year after I published the first English translation of this work, 
he writes: 

Since then, 
the state of affairs has certainly undergone a 
change;
my contribution to the interpretation of dreams is no longer ignored in the literature of the subject.

But the new situation makes it even more impossible to continue the foregoing summary.

The Interpretation of Dreams has evoked a whole 
series of new contentions and problems, 
which have been expounded by the authors in the most varied fashions.
But I cannot discuss these works until I have developed the theories to 
which their authors have referred.

Whatever has appeared to me 
as valuable in this recent literature, 
I have accordingly reviewed 
in the course of the following exposition.
 
The epigraph on the title-page of this volume indicates the tradition to which I prefer to ally myself in my conception of the 
dream.

I am proposing to show that dreams are capable of interpretation;
and any contributions to the solution of the problem 
which have already been discussed will emerge only as possible 
by-products in the accomplishment of my special task.
On the hypothesis that dreams are susceptible of interpretation, 
I at once find myself in disagreement with the prevailing doctrine of 
dreams —
in fact, 
with all the theories of dreams, 
excepting only that of Schemer, 
for to interpret a dream,
is to specify its meaning, 
to replace it by something which takes its position 
in the concatenation of our psychic activities as a link of definite 
importance and value.

But, 
as we have seen, 
the scientific theories 
of the dream leave no room for a problem of dream-interpretation;
since, 
in the first place, 
according to these theories, 
dreaming is not a psychic activity at all, 
but a somatic process which 
makes itself known to the psychic apparatus by means of symbols.

Lay opinion has always been opposed to these theories.
It asserts its privilege of proceeding illogically, 
and although it 
admits that dreams are incomprehensible and absurd, 
it cannot 
summon up the courage to deny that dreams have any significance.

Led by a dim intuition, 
it seems rather to assume that 
dreams have a meaning, 
albeit a hidden one;
that they are intended 
as a substitute for some other thought-process, 
and that 
we have only to disclose this substitute correctly in order to 
discover the hidden meaning of the dream.
 
The unscientific world, 
therefore, 
has always endeavored to 
interpret dreams, 
and by applying one or the other of two 
essentially different methods.

The first of these methods envisages the dream-content as a whole, 
and seeks to replace it by 
another content, 
which is intelligible and in certain respects analogous.

This is symbolic dream-interpretation;
and of course it 
goes to pieces at the very outset in the case of those dreams 
which are not only unintelligible but confused.

The construction 
which the biblical Joseph placed upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of this method.

The seven fat ldne, 
after which 
came seven lean ones that devoured the former, 
were a symbolic 
substitute for seven years of famine in the land of Egypt, 
which 
according to the prediction were to consume all the surplus that 
seven fruitful years had produced.

Most of the artificial dreams 
contrived by the poets 1 are intended for some such symbolic interpretation, 
for they reproduce the thought conceived by the 
poet in a guise not unlike the disguise which we are wont to find 
in our dreams.
 
The idea that the dream concerns itself chiefly with the future, 
whose form it surmises in advance —
a relic of the prophetic significance with which dreams were once invested —
now becomes 
the motive for translating into the future the meaning of the 
dream which has been found by means of symbolic interpretation. 

A demonstration of the manner in which one arrives at such a 
symbolic interpretation cannot, 
of course, 
be given.

Success remains a matter of ingenious conjecture, 
of direct intuition, 
and for this reason dream-interpretation has naturally been elevated 
into an art which seems to depend upon extraordinary gifts.

The second of the two popular methods of dream-interpretation entirely abandons such claims.
It might be described as the cipher method, 
since it treats the dream as a kind of secret code in 
which every sign is translated into another sign of known meaning, 
according to an established key.

For example, 
I have dreamt 
of a letter, 
and also of a funeral or the like;
I consult a dreambook, 
33 and I find that letter 3 is to be translated by vexation 33 
and funeral 33 by engagement.

It now remains to establish 
a connection, 
which I am again to assume as pertaining to the 
future, 
by means of the rigmarole which I have deciphered.

An 
interesting variant of this cipher procedure, 
a variant in which 
its character of purely mechanical transference is to a certain 
extent corrected, 
is presented in the work on dream-interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis .

Here not only the dream-content, 
but also the personality and social position of the dreamer are 
taken into consideration, 
so that the same dream-content has a 
significance for the rich man, 
the married man, 
or the orator,  
which is different from that which applies to the poor man, 
the bachelor, 
or, 
let us say, 
the merchant.

The essential point, 
then,  
in this procedure is that the work of interpretation is not applied 
to the entirety of the dream, 
but to each portion of the dreamcontent severally, 
as though the dream were a conglomerate in 
which each fragment calls for special treatment.

Incoherent and 
confused dreams are certaintly those that have been responsible 
for the invention of the cipher method .

The worthlessness of both these popular methods of interprewriter relates as follows:
Pour inter pr iter exactement un songe les onirom anciens les plus habiles s’informent de ceux qui les consultent de toutes les 
circonstances qu’ils regardent nScessaires pour la bonne explication.

En

demands for precise information in respect to near relatives,

children,
as well as the following formula: 
habistine in hoc node copulam 
conjugalem ante vel post somnium? —
L’idSe dominante dans Vinter prita tion des songes consiste a expliquer le reve par son oppose. 

talion does not admit of discussion.

As regards the scientific 
treatment of the subject, 
the symbolic method is limited in its 
application, 
and is not susceptible of a general exposition.

In the 
cipher method everything depends upon whether the key, 
the dream-book, 
is reliable, 
and for that all guarantees are lacking.
 
So that one might be tempted to grant the contention of the 
philosophers and psychiatrists, 
and to dismiss the problem of 
dream-interpretation as altogether fanciful.

I have, 
however, 
come to think differently.

I have been forced 
to perceive that here, 
once more, 
we have one of those not infrequent cases where an ancient and stubbornly retained popular 
belief seems to have come nearer to the truth of the matter than 
the opinion of modern science.

I must insist that the dream actually does possess a meaning, 
and that a scientific method of 
dream-interpretation is possible.
I arrived at my knowledge of 
this method in the following manner: 
For years I have been occupied with the resolution of certain 
psychopathological structures — hysterical phobias, 
obsessional ideas, 
and the like— 
with therapeutic intentions.

I have been so 
occupied, 
in fact, 
ever since I heard the significant statement of Joseph Breuer, 
to the effect that in these structures, 
regarded as 
morbid symptoms, 
solution and treatment go hand in hand.
 
Where it has been possible to trace a pathological idea back to 
those elements in the psychic life of the patient to which it owed 
its origin, 
this idea has crumbled away, 
and the patient has been 
relieved of it.

In view of the failure of our other therapeutic 
efforts, 
and in the face of the mysterious character of these pathological conditions, 
it seemed to me tempting, 
in spite of all the 
difficulties, 
to follow the method initiated by Breuer until a 
complete elucidation of the subject had been achieved.

I shall 
have occasion elsewhere to give a detailed account of the form
which the technique of this procedure has finally assumed, 
and of 
the results of my efforts.
In the course of these psychoanalytic 
studies, 
I happened upon the question of dream-interpretation.
 
My patients, 
after I had pledged them to inform me of all the 
ideas and thoughts which occurred to them in connection with 
a given theme, 
related their dreams, 
and thus taught me that a 
dream may be interpolated in the psychic concatenation, 
which may be followed backwards from a pathological idea into a patient’s memory.
The next step was to treat the dream itself as a 
symptom, 
and to apply to it the method of interpretation which 
had been worked out for such symptoms.
 
For this a certain psychic preparation on the part of the patient is necessary.
A twofold effort is made, 
to stimulate his attentiveness in respect of his psychic perceptions, 
and to eliminate 
the critical spirit in which he is ordinarily in the habit of viewing such thoughts as come to the surface.

For the purpose of selfobservation with concentrated attention it is advantageous that 
the patient should take up a restful position and close his eyes;
 he must be explicitly instructed to renounce all criticism of the 
thought formations which he may perceive.

He must also be 
told that the success of the psychoanalysis depends upon his noting and communicating everything that passes through his mind, 
and that he must not allow himself to suppress one idea because 
it seems to him unimportant or irrelevant to the subject, 
or another because it seems nonsensical.

He must preserve an absolute 
impartiality in respect to his ideas;
for if he is unsuccessful in 
finding the desired solution of the dream, 
the obsessional idea, 
or the like, 
it will be because he permits himself to be critical of 
them.
 
I have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytical work that 
the psychological state of a man in an attitude of reflection is 
entirely different from that of a man who is observing his psychic 
processes.

In reflection there is a greater play of psychic activity 
than in the most attentive self-observation;
this is shown even by 
the tense attitude and the wrinkled brow of the man in a state of 
reflection, 
as opposed to the mimic tranquillity of the man observing himself.

In both cases there must be concentrated attention, 
but the reflective man makes use of his critical faculties, 
with the result that he rejects some of the thoughts which rise into 
consciousness after he has become aware of them, 
and abruptly 
interrupts others, 
so that he does not follow the lines of thought 
which they would otherwise open up for him;
while in respect of 
yet other thoughts he is able to behave in such a manner that they 
do not become conscious at all — 
that is to say, 
they are suppressed before they are perceived.

In self-observation, 
on the other hand, 
he has but one task — that of suppressing criticism; 
if he succeeds in doing this, 
an unlimited number of thoughts 
enter his consciousness which would otherwise have eluded his 
grasp.

With the aid of the material thus obtained — material 
which is new to the self-observer — it is possible to achieve the interpretation of pathological ideas, 
and also that of dream-formations.
As will be seen, 
the point is to induce a psychic state which 
is in some degree analogous, 
as regards the distribution of psychic 
energy (mobile attention), 
to the state of the mind before falling 
asleep —
and also, 
of course, 
to the hypnotic state.

On falling 
asleep the undesired ideas emerge, 
owing to the slackening of 
a certain arbitrary (and, 
of course, 
also critical) action, 
which 
is allowed to influence the trend of our ideas;
we are accustomed 
to speak of fatigue as the reason of this slackening;
the merging 
undesired ideas are changed into visual and auditory images.

In the condition which it utilized for the analysis of dreams and 
pathological ideas, 
this activity is purposely and deliberately 
renounced, 
and the psychic energy thus saved (or some part of it) is employed in attentively tracking the undesired thoughts 
which now come to the surface — thoughts which retain their 
identity as ideas (in which the condition differs from the state 
of falling asleep).

Undesired ideas are thus changed into desired ones.

There are many people who do not seem to find it easy to adopt 
the required attitude toward the apparently freely rising ideas,  
and to renounce the criticism which is otherwise applied to them.

The undesired ideas habitually evoke the most violent resistance, 
which seeks to prevent them from coming to the surface.
 
But if we may credit our great poet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller, 
the essential condition of poetical creation includes a very 
similar attitude.

In a certain passage in his correspondence with 
Korner (for the tracing of which we are indebted to Otto Rank),  
Schiller replies in the following words to a friend who complains 
of his lack of creative power: The reason for your complaint lies, 
it seems to me, 
in the constraint which your intellect imposes 
upon your imagination.

Here I will make an observation, 
and illustrate it by an allegory.

Apparently it is not good — and indeed it hinders the creative work of the mind — if the intellect 
examines too closely the ideas already pouring in, 
as it were, 
at the gates.

Regarded in isolation, 
an idea may be quite insignificant, 
and venturesome in the extreme, 
but it may acquire importance from an idea which follows it;
perhaps, 
in a certain collocation with other ideas, 
which may seem equally absurd, 
it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable link.

The intellect 
cannot judge all these ideas unless it can retain them until it has 
considered them in connection with these other ideas.

In the case 
of a creative mind, 
it seems to me, 
the intellect has withdrawn its 
watchers from the gates, 
and the ideas rush in pell-mell, 
and only 
then does it review and inspect the multitude.

You worthy critics, 
or whatever you may call yourselves, 
are ashamed or afraid 
of the momentary and passing madness which is found in all 
real creators, 
the longer or shorter duration of which distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.

Hence your complaints of unfruitfulness, 
for you reject too soon and discriminate 
too severely (letter of December i, 
1788).

And yet, 
such a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of 
the intellect, 
as Schiller puts it, 
such a translation into the condition of uncritical self-observation, 
is by no means difficult.
 
Most of my patients accomplish it after my first instructions, 
myself can do so very completely, 
if I assist the process by writing down the ideas that flasli through my mind.

The quantum 
of psychic energy by which the critical activity is thus reduced,  
and by which the intensity of self-observation may be increased,  
varies considerably according to the subject-matter upon which 
the attention is to be fixed.

The first step in the application of this procedure teaches us 
that one cannot make the dream as a whole the object of one’s 
attention, 
but only the individual components of its content.
 
If I ask a patient who is as yet unpractised: What occurs to you 
in connection with this dream ?  he is unable, 
as a rule, 
to fix upon 
anything in his psychic field of vision.

I must first dissect the 
dream for him;
then, 
in connection with each fragment, 
he gives 
me a number of ideas which may be described as the thoughts 
behind this part of the dream.
In this first and important condition, 
then, 
the method of dream-interpretation which I employ 
diverges from the popular, 
historical and legendary method of 
interpretation by symbolism and approaches more nearly to the 
second or cipher method.
Like this, 
it is an interpretation in 
detail, 
not en masse;
like this, 
it conceives the dream, 
from tire 
outset, 
as something built up, 
as a conglomerate of psychic formations.
 

In the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics I have already 
subjected perhaps more than a thousand dreams to interpretation, 
but I do not wish to use this material now as an introduction to the theory and technique of dream-interpretation.

For 
quite apart from the fact that I should lay myself open to the 
objection that these are the dreams of neuropaths, 
so that the 
conclusions drawn from them would not apply to the dreams of 
healthy persons, 
there is another reason that impels me to reject 
them.

The theme to which these dreams point is, 
of course, 
always the history of the malady that is responsible for the neurosis.

Hence every dream would require a very long introduction, 
and an investigation of the nature and etiological conditions 
of the psychoneuroses, 
matters which are in themselves novel 
and exceedingly strange, 
and which would therefore distract attention from the dream-problem proper.

My purpose is rather 
to prepare the way, 
by the solution of the dream-problem, 
for 
the solution of the more difficult problems of the psychology of 
the neuroses.

But if I eliminate the dreams of neurotics, 
which 
constitute my principal material, 
I cannot be too fastidious in 
my treatment of the rest.

Only those dreams are left which have 
been incidentally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, 
or which I find given as examples in the literature 
of dream-life.

Unfortunately, 
in all these dreams I am deprived 
of the analysis without which I cannot find the meaning of the 
dream.
My mode of procedure is, 
of course, 
less easy than that of 
the popular cipher method, 
which translates the given dreamcontent by reference to an established key;
I, 
on the contrary,  
hold that the same dream-content may conceal a different 
meaning in the case of different persons, 
or in different connections.

I must, 
therefore, 
resort to my own dreams as a source of 
abundant and convenient material, 
furnished by a person who 
is more or less normal, 
and containing references to many incidents of everyday life.
I shall certainly be confronted with doubts 
as to the trustworthiness of these self-analyses, 
and it will be 
said that arbitrariness is by no means excluded in such analyses.
 
In my own judgment, 
conditions are more likely to be favourable 
in self-observation than in the observation of others;
in any case,  
it is permissible to investigate how much can be accomplished in 
the matter of dream-interpretation by means of self-analysis.

There are other difficulties which must be overcome in my own 
inner self.
One has a comprehensible aversion to exposing so 
many intimate details of one’s own psychic life, 
and one does 
not feel secure against the misinterpretations of strangers.
But 
one must be able to transcend such considerations.
Tout psy ckologiste, 
writes Delbceuf, 
est obligi de jaire Vaveu meme de 
ses faiblesses s’il croit par Id jeter du jour sur quelque problbntc 
obscur And I may assume for the reader that his initial interest 
in the indiscretions which I must commit will very soon give way 
to an exclusive engrossment in the psychological problems elucidated by them. 

I shall therefore select one of my own dreams for the purpose 
of elucidating my method of interpretation.

Every such dream 
necessitates a preliminary statement;
so that I must now beg the 
reader to make my interests his own for a time, 
and to become 
absorbed, 
with me, 
in the most trifling details of my life;
for an 
interest in the hidden significance of dreams imperatively demands just such a transference.
 
In the summer of 1895 1 had treated psycho-analytically a young 
lady who was an intimate friend of mine and of my family.

It 
will be understood that such complicated relations may excite 
manifold feelings in the physician, 
and especially the psychotherapist.

The personal interest of the physician is greater, 
but his 
authority less.

If he fails, 
his friendship with the patient’s relatives is in danger of being undermined.
In this case, 
however,  
the treatment ended in partial success;
the patient was cured of 
her hysterical anxiety, 
but not of all her somatic symptoms.

At 
that time I was not yet quite sure of the criteria which denote 
the final cure of an hysterical case, 
and I expected her to accept 
a solution which did not seem acceptable to her.

In the midst of 
this disagreement we discontinued the treatment for the summer 
holidays.

One day a younger colleague, 
one of my most intimate 
friends, 
who had visited the patient — Irma — and her family in 
their country residence, 
called upon me.

I asked him how Irma 
was, 
and received the reply: She is better, 
but not quite well.
 
I realize that these words of my friend Otto’s, 
or the tone of voice 
in which they were spoken, 
annoyed me.

I thought I heard a reproach in the words, 
perhaps to the effect that I had promised 
the patient too much, 
and — rightly or wrongly — I attributed 
Otto’s apparent taking sides against me to the influence of the 
patient’s relatives, 
who, 
I assumed, 
had never approved of my 
treatment.

This disagreeable impression, 
however, 
did not become clear to me, 
nor did I speak of it.

That same evening I wrote 
the clinical history of Irma’s case, 
in order to give it, 
as though 
to justify myself, 
to Dr M,
a mutual friend, 
who was at that 
time the leading personality in our circle.

During the night
or rather in the early morning
I had the following dream, 
which I 
recorded immediately after waking:
Dream of July 23-24, 
1895 
A great hall — 
a number of guests, 
whom we are receiving — 
among them Irma, 
whom I immediately take aside, 
as though to 
answer her letter, 
and to reproach her for not yet accepting the 
solution  I say to her: If you still have pains, 
it is really only 
your own fault  — 
She answers: If you only knew what pains 
I have now in the throat, 
stomach, 
and abdomen— 
I am choked 
by them.

I am startled, 
and look at her.

She looks pale and 
This is the first dream which I subjected to an exhaustive interpretation.
 
puffy
think that after all I must be overlooking some organic 
affection.
I take her to the window and look into her throat.

She 
offers some, 
resistance to this, 
like, 
a woman who has a set of false 
teeth .

I think, 
surely, 
she, 
doesn’t need them.

The mouth then 
opens wide,  
and I find a large white spot on the right, 
and elsewhere 1 sec extensive, 
grayish-white scabs adhering to curiously 
curled formations, 
which are evidently shaped like the turbinal 
bones of the
nose.

I quickly call Dr M, 
who repeats the examination and confirms it.
Dr M looks quite unlike his usual self;
he is very pale, 
he limps, 
and his chin is clean-shaven.
 
Now my friend Otto, 
too, 
is standing beside her, 
and my friend 
Leopold percusses her covered chest, 
and says: She has a dullness below, 
on the left, 
and also calls attention to an infiltrated 
portion of skin on the left shoulder ( which I can feel, 
in spite of 
the dress).
M says:  There’s no doubt that it’s an infection,  
but it doesn’t matter;
dysentery will follow and the poison will 
be eliminated.

We know, 
too, 
precisely how the infection 
originated.

My friend Otto, 
not long ago, 
gave her, 
when she was 
feeling unwell, 
an injection of a preparation of propyl,
propyls, 
propionic acid, 
trimelhylamin, 
the formula of which I see before me, 
printed in heavy type.

One doesn’t give 
such injections so rashly, 
Probably, 
too, 
the syringe was not 
clean.
 
This dream has an advantage over many others.

It is at once 
obvious to what events of the preceding day it is related, 
and of 
what subject it treats.

The preliminary statement explains these 
matters.

The news of Inna’s health which I had received from 
Otto, 
and the clinical history, 
which I was writing late into the 
night, 
had occupied my psychic activities even during sleep.
 
Nevertheless, 
no one who had read the preliminary report, 
and 
had knowledge of the content of the dream, 
could guess what 
the dream signified.

Nor do I myself know.

I am puzzled by the 
morbid symptoms of which Irma complains in the dream, 
for 
they are not the symptoms for which I treated her.

I smile at 
the nonsensical idea of an injection of propionic acid, 
and at Dr M’s attempt at consolation.

Towards the end the dream seems 
more obscure and quicker in tempo than at the beginning.

In 
order to learn the significance of all these details I resolve to 
undertake an exhaustive analysis.
 
The hall — a number of guests, 
whom we arc receiving.
We were 
living that summer at Bellevue, 
an isolated house on one of the 
hills adjoining the Kahlenberg.
This house was originally built 
as a place of entertainment, 
and therefore has unusually lofty, 
hall-lilce rooms.

The dream was dreamed in Bellevue, 
a few days 
before my wife’s birthday.

During the day my wife had mentioned that she expected several friends, 
and among them Irma, 
 to come to us as guests for her birthday.

My dream, 
then, 
anticipates this situation: It is my wife’s birthday, 
and we are receiving a number of people, 
among them Irma, 
as guests in the 
large hall of Bellevue. 
 
I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution, 
I say, 
If you still have pains, 
it is really your own fault I might even 
have said this while awake;
I may have actually said it.

At that 
time I was of the opinion recognized (later to be incorrect) that 
my task was limited to informing patients of the hidden meaning 
of their symptoms.

Whether they then accepted or did not accept 
the solution upon which success depended — for that I was not 
responsible.

I am grateful to this error, 
which, 
fortunately, 
has 
now been overcome, 
since it made life easier for me at a time 
when, 
with all my unavoidable ignorance, 
I was expected to effect 
successful cures.

But I note that in the speech which I make to 
Irma in the dream I am above all anxious that I shall not be 
blamed for the pains which she still sufiers.

If it is Irma’s own 
fault, 
it cannot be mine.

Should the purpose of the dream be 
looked for in this quarter? 

Irma's complaints —
pains in the neck, 
abdomen, 
and stomach;
she is choked by them.

Pains in the stomach belonged to the 
symptom-complex of my patient, 
but they were not very prominent;
she complained rather of qualms and a feeling of nausea.
 
Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of the throat 
played hardly any part in her case.

I wonder why I have decided 
upon this choice of symptoms in the dream;
for the moment I 
cannot discover the reason.

She looks pale and puffy.

My patient had always a rosy complexion.

I suspect that here another person is being substituted 
for her.

I am startled at the idea that I may have overlooked some or ganic affection.

This, 
as the reader will readily believe, 
is a constant fear with the specialist who sees neurotics almost exclusively, 
and who is accustomed to ascribe to hysteria so many manifestations which other physicians treat as organic.

On the other 
hand, 
I am haunted by a faint doubt — I do not know whence 
it comes — -whether my alarm is altogether honest.

If Irma’s pains 
are indeed of organic origin, 
it is not my duty to cure them.

My treatment, 
of course, 
removes only hysterical pains.

It seems to me, 
in fact, 
that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis;
for then 
I could not be reproached with failure to effect a cure.
 
I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. 
She resists a little, 
like a woman who has false teeth.
I think to myself, 
 
she does not need them.
I had never had occasion to inspect 
Irma’s oral cavity.

The incident in the dream reminds me of an 
examination, 
made some time before, 
of a governess who at first 
produced an impression of youthful beauty, 
but who, 
upon opening her mouth, 
took certain measures to conceal her denture.
 
Other memories of medical examinations, 
and of petty secrets 
revealed by them, 
to the embarrassment of both physician and 
patient, 
associate themselves with this case.

She surely does 
not need them, 
is perhaps in the first place a compliment to 
Irma;
but I suspect yet another meaning.

In a careful analysis 
one is able to feel whether or not the arriere-pensees which are 
to be expected have all been exhausted.

The way in which Irma 
stands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience.
 
Irma has an intimate woman friend of whom I think very highly.
 
One evening, 
on paying her a visit, 
I found her at the window in 
the position reproduced in the dream, 
and her physician, 
the same Dr M,
declared that she had a diphtheritic membrane.
 
The person of Dr M
and the membrane return, 
indeed, 
in the 
course of the dream.

Now it occurs to me that during the past 
few months I have had every reason to suppose that this lady too 
is hysterical.

Yes, 
Irma herself betrayed the fact to me.

But what 
do I know of her condition? Only the one thing, 
that like Irma 
in the dream she suffers from hysterical choking.

Thus, 
in the 
dream I have replaced my patient by her friend.

Now I remember that I have often played with the supposition that this lady, 
too, 
might ask me to relieve her of her symptoms.

But even at the 
time I thought it improbable since she is extremely reserved.

She 
resists, 
as the dream shows.

Another explanation might be that 
she does not need it;
in fact, 
until now she has shown herself 
strong enough to master her condition without outside help.

Now 
only a few features remain, 
which I can assign neither to Irma 
nor to her friend;
pale, 
puffy, 
false teeth.

The false teeth led me 
to the governess;
I now feel inclined to be satisfied with bad 
teeth.

Here another person, 
to whom these features may allude,  
occurs to me.

She is not my patient, 
and I do not wish her to be 
my patient, 
for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with 
me, 
and I do not consider her a docile patient.

She is generally 
pale, 
and once, 
when she had not felt particularly well, 
she was 
puffy.

I have thus compared my patient Irma with two others, 
who would likewise resist treatment.

What is the meaning of the 
fact that I have exchanged her for her friend in the dream? Perhaps that I wish to exchange her;
either her friend arouses in me 
stronger sympathies, 
or I have a higher regard for her intelligence.

For I consider Irma foolish because she does not accept my 
solution.

The other woman would be more sensible, 
and would 
thus be more likely to yield.

The mouth then opens readily;
she 
would tell more than Irma.

What I see in the throat: a white spot and scabby turbinal 
bones.

The white spot recalls diphtheria, 
and thus Irma’s friend, 
but it also recalls the grave illness of my eldest daughter two 
years earlier, 
and all the anxiety of that unhappy time.

The 
scab on the turbinal bones reminds me of my anxiety concerning 
my own health.

At that time I frequently used cocaine in order to 
suppress distressing swellings in the nose, 
and I had heard a few 
days previously that a lady patient who did likewise had contracted an extensive necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane.

In 1885 it was I who had recommended the use of cocaine, 
and I 
had been gravely reproached in consequence.

A dear friend, 
who had died before the date of this dream, 
had hastened his end by 
the misuse of this remedy.
 
I quickly call Dr M, 
who refeats the examination.

This would 
simply correspond to the position which M occupied among us.
 
But the word quickly is striking enough to demand a special 
examination.

It reminds me of a sad medical experience.

By continually prescribing a drug, 
sulphonal, 
which at that time was 
still considered harmless, 
I was once responsible for a condition 
of acute poisoning in the case of a woman patient, 
and hastily 
turned for assistance to my older and more experienced colleague.

The fact that I really had this case in mind is confirmed by a 
subsidiary circumstance.

The patient, 
who succumbed to the 
toxic effects of the drug, 
bore the same name as my eldest daughter.

I had never thought of this until now;
but now it seems to me 
almost like a retribution of fate — 
as though the substitution of 
persons had to be continued in another sense: this Matilda for 
that Matilda;
an eye for an eye, 
a tooth for a tooth.

It is as 
though I were seeking every opportunity to reproach myself for 
a lack of medical conscientiousness.

Dr M
is pale;
his chin is shaven, 
and he limps.

Of this so 
much is correct, 
that his unhealthy appearance often arouses the 
concern of his friends.

The other two characteristics must belong 
to another person.

An elder brother living abroad occurs to me, 
for he, 
too, 
shaves his chin, 
and if I remember him rightly, 
the M
of the dream bears on the whole a certain resemblance to him.
 
And some days previously the news arrived that he was limping 
on account of an arthritic affection of the hip.

There must be 
some reason why I fuse the two persons into one in my dream.
 
I remember that, 
in fact, 
I was on bad terms with both of them 
for similar reasons.

Both had rejected a certain proposal which 
I had recently made them.
 
My friend Otto is now standing next to the patient, 
and my 
friend Leopold examines her and calls attention to a dulncss low 
down on the left side.

My friend Leopold also is a physician, 
and a relative of Otto’s.

Since the two practise the same speciality, 
fate has made them competitors, 
so that they are constantly 
being compared with one another.

Both of them assisted me for 
years, 
while I was still directing a public clinic for neurotic 
children.

There, 
scenes like that reproduced in my dream had 
often taken place.

While I would be discussing the diagnosis of 
a case with Otto, 
Leopold would examine the child anew and 
make an unexpected contribution towards our decision.

There 
was a difference of character between the two men like that between Inspector Brasig and his friend Karl.

Otto was remarkably 
prompt and alert;
Leopold was slow and thoughtful, 
but thorough.

If I contrast Otto and the cautious Leopold in the dream 
I do so, 
apparently, 
in order to extol Leopold.

The comparison 
is like that made above between the disobedient patient Irma 
and her friend, 
who was believed to be more sensible.

I now become aware of one of the tracks along which the association of 
ideas in the dream proceeds: from the sick child to the children’s 
clinic.

Concerning the dulness low on the left side, 
I have the 
impression that it corresponds with a certain case of which all the 
details were similar, 
a case in which Leopold impressed me by his 
thoroughness.

I thought vaguely, 
too, 
of something like a metastatic affection, 
but it might also be a reference to the patient 
whom I should have liked to have in Irma’s place.

For this lady, 
as far as I can gather, 
exhibited symptoms which imitated tuberculosis. 

An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder.

I know at 
once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, 
which I 
always feel if I lie awake long at night.

The very phrasing of the 
dream sounds ambiguous: Something which I can feel, 
as he does, 
in spite of the dress.

Feel on my own body is intended.
 
Further, 
it occurs to me how unusual the phrase infiltrated portion of skin sounds.

We are accustomed to the phrase: an infiltration 
of the upper posterior left;
this would refer to the 
lungs, 
and thus, 
once more, 
to tuberculosis.
 
In spite of the dress.

This, 
to be sure, 
is only an interpolation.
 
At the clinic the children were, 
of course, 
examined undressed;
here we have some contrast to the manner in which adult female 
patients have to be examined.

The story used to be told of an 
eminent physician that he always examined his patients through 
their clothes.

The rest is obscure to me;
I have, 
frankly, 
no 
inclination to follow the matter further.
 
Dr M says: 
It’s an infection, 
but it doesn’t matter;
dysentery will follow, 
and the poison wiU be eliminated 
This, 
at first,  
seems to me ridiculous;
nevertheless, 
like everything else, 
it 
must be carefully analysed;
more closely observd it seems after 
all to have a sort of meaning.

What I had found in the patient 
was a local diphtheritis.

I remember the discussion about diphtheritis and diphtheria at the time of my daughter’s illness.
 
Diphtheria is the general infection which proceeds from local 
diphtheritis.

Leopold demonstrates the existence of such a 
general infection by the dulness, 
which also suggests a metastatic 
focus.

I believe, 
however, 
that just this kind of metastasis does 
not occur in the case of diphtheria.

It reminds me rather of 
pyaemia.
 
It doesn’t matter is a consolation.

I believe it fits in as follows: The last part of the dream has yielded a content to the 
effect that the patient’s sufferings are the result of a serious organic affection.

I begin to suspect that by this I am only trying 
to shift the blame from myself.

Psychic treatment cannot be 
held responsible for the continued presence of a diphtheritic 
affection.

Now, 
indeed, 
I am distressed by the thought of having 
invented such a serious illness for Irma, 
for the sole purpose of 
exculpating myself.

It seems so cruel.

Accordingly, 
I need the 
assurance that the outcome will be benign, 
and it seems to me 
that I made a good choice when I put the words that consoled me 
into the mouth of Dr M, 
But here I am placing myself in a 
position of superiority to the dream;
a fact which needs explanation. 

But why is this consolation so nonsensical? 
Dysentery.

Some sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that the 
toxins of disease might be eliminated through the intestines.

Am I thereby trying to make fun of Dr M’s
remarkable store of 
far-fetched explanations, 
his habit of conceiving curious pathological relations? Dysentery suggests something else.

A few 
months ago I had in my care a young man who was suffering 
from remarkable intestinal troubles;
a case which had been 
treated by other colleagues as one of anaemia with malnutrition.

I realized that it was a case of hysteria;
I was unwilling 
to use my psychotherapy on him, 
and sent him off on a seavoyage.

Now a few days previously I had received a despairing 
letter from him;
he wrote from Egypt, 
saying that he had had a 
fresh attack, 
which the doctor had declared to be dysentery.

I suspect that the diagnosis is merely an error on the part of an 
ignorant colleague, 
who is allowing himself to be fooled by the 
hysteria;
yet I cannot help reproaching myself for putting the 
invalid in a position where he might contract some organic affection of the bowels in addition to his hysteria.

Furthermore, 
dysentery sounds not unlike diphtheria, 
a word which does not 
occur in the dream.
 
Yes, 
it must be the case that with the consoling prognosis,  
Dysentery will develop, 
etc.
 
I am making fun of Dr M, 
for 
I recollect that years ago he once jestingly told a very similar 
story of a colleague.

He had been called in to consult with him 
in the case of a woman who was very seriously ill, 
and he felt 
obliged to confront his colleague, 
who seemed very hopeful, 
with 
the fact that he found albumen in the patient’s urine.

His colleague, 
however, 
did not allow this to worry him, 
but answered 
calmly: That does not matter, 
my dear sir;
the albumen will 
soon be excreted! Thus I can no longer doubt that this part of 
the dream expresses derision for those of my colleagues who are 
ignorant of hysteria.

And, 
as though in confirmation, 
the thought 
enters my mind: Does Dr M
know that the appearances in 
Irma’s friend, 
his patient, 
which gave him reason to fear tuberculosis, 
are likewise due to hysteria? Has he recognized this 
hysteria, 
or has he allowed himself to be fooled? 

But what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? 
That is simple enough: Dr M 
agrees with my solution as little 
as does Irma herself.

Thus, 
in this dream I have already revenged 
myself on two persons: on Irma in the words, 
If you still have 
pains, 
it is your own fault, 
and on Dr M
in the wording of 
the nonsensical consolation which has been put into his mouth. 

We know precisely how the infection originated.

This precise 
knowledge in the dream is remarkable.

Only a moment before 
this we did not yet know of the infection, 
since it was first demonstrated by Leopold.
 
My friend Otto gave her an infection not long ago, 
when she 
was feeling unwell.

Otto had actually related during his short 
visit to Irma’s family that he had been called in to a neighbouring 
hotel in order to give an injection to someone who had been 
suddenly taken ill.

Injections remind me once more of the unfortunate friend who poisoned himself with cocaine.

I had recommended the remedy for internal use only during the withdrawal 
of morphia;

but he immediately gave himself injections of 
cocaine.
 
With a preparation of propyl, 
propyls, 
propionic acid,  
How on earth did this occur to me? On the evening of the day 
after I had written the clinical history and dreamed about the 
case, 
my wife opened a bottle of liqueur labelled Ananas, 
which was a present from our friend, 
Otto.

He had, 
as a matter of 
fact, 
a habit of making presents on every possible occasion;
I 
hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife.
This liqueur 
smelt so strongly of fusel oil that I refused to drink it.

My wife 
suggested: We will give the bottle to the servants, 
and I, 
more 
prudent, 
objected, 
with the philanthropic remark: They shan’t 
be poisoned either.

The smell of fusel oil, 
amyl, 
has now 
apparently awakened my memory of the whole series: propyl,  
methyl, 
etc.
 
which furnished the preparation of propyl mentioned in the dream. 

Here, 
indeed, 
I have effected a substitution: 
I dreamt of propyl after smelling amyl;
but substitutions of this 
kind are perhaps permissible, 
especially in organic chemistry.
 
Ananas, 
moreover, 
has a remarkable assonance with the family name 
of my patient Irma.
 
In this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic.

But in another sense 
it proved correct, 
for the unsolved stomach pains, 
for which I did not 
want to be blamed, 
were the forerunners of a serious illness, 
due to gallstones.
 

Trimethylamin.

In the dream I see the chemical formula of 
this substance — which at all events is evidence of a great effort on 
the part of my memory — and the formula is even printed in 
heavy type, 
as though to distinguish it from the context as 
something of particular importance.

And where does trimethylamin, 
thus forced on my attention, 
lead me? To a conversation 
with another friend, 
who for years has been familiar with all my 
germinating ideas, 
and I with his.

At that time he had just informed me of certain ideas concerning a sexual chemistry, 
and 
had mentioned, 
among others, 
that he thought he had found in 
trimethylamin one of the products of sexual metabolism.

This 
substance thus leads me to sexuality, 
the factor to which I attribute the greatest significance in respect of the origin of these 
nervous affections which I am trying to cure.

My patient Irma 
is a young widow;
if I am required to excuse my failure to cure 
her, 
I shall perhaps do best to refer to this condition, 
which her 
admirers would be glad to terminate.

But in what a singular 
fashion such a dream is fitted together! The friend who in my 
dream becomes my patient in Irma’s place is likewise a young 
widow.
 
I surmise why it is that the formula of trimethylamin is so insistent in the dream.

So many important things are centred about 
this one word: trimethylamin is an allusion, 
not merely to the 
all-important factor of sexuality, 
but also to a friend whose sympathy I remember with satisfaction whenever I feel isolated in 
my opinions.

And this friend, 
who plays such a large part in my 
life: will he not appear yet again in the concatenation of ideas 
peculiar to this dream? 
Of course;
he has a special knowledge of 
the results of affections of the nose and the sinuses, 
and has 
revealed to science several highly remarkable relations between 
the turbinal bones and the female sexual organs.

The three 
curly formations in Irma’s throat.

I got him to examine Irma, 
in 
order to determine whether her gastric pains were of nasal origin.
 
But he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis, 
which gives me 
concern, 
and to this perhaps there is an allusion in pyaemia, 
 
which hovers before me in the metastasis of the dream. 

One doesn’t give stick injections so rashly.

Here the reproach 
of rashness is hurled directly at my friend Otto.

I believe I had 
some such thought in the afternoon, 
when he seemed to indicate, 
by word and look, 
that he had taken sides against me.

It was, 
perhaps: How easily he is influenced;
how irresponsibly he 
pronounces judgment.

Further, 
the above sentence points once 
more to my deceased friend, 
who so irresponsibly resorted to 
cocaine injections.

As I have said, 
I had not intended that injections of the drug should be taken.
 
I note that in reproaching Otto 
I once more touch upon the story of the unfortunate Matilda, 
which was the pretext for the same reproach against me.

Here,  
obviously, 
I am collecting examples of my conscientiousness,  
and also of the reverse.

Probably too the syringe was not clean. 

Another reproach 
directed at Otto, 
but originating elsewhere.

On the previous day 
I happened to meet the son of an old lady of eighty-two, 
to whom 
I am obliged to give two injections of morphia daily.

At present 
she is in the country, 
and I have heard that she is suffering from 
phlebitis.

I immediately thought that this might be a case of 
infiltration caused by a dirty syringe.

It is my pride that in two 
years I have not given her a single infiltration;
I am always 
careful, 
of course, 
to see that the syringe is perfectly dean.

For 
I am conscientious.

From the phlebitis I return to my wife, 
who 
once suffered from thrombosis during a period of pregnancy, 
and 
now three related situations come to the surface in my memory, 
 
involving my wife, 
Irma, 
and the dead Matilda, 
whose identity 
has apparently justified my putting these three persons in one 
another’s places.
 
I have now completed the interpretation of the dream. 
 
In the 
course of this interpretation I have taken great pains to avoid all 
those notions which must have been suggested by a comparison 
of the dream-content with the dream-thoughts hidden behind 
this content. 

Meanwhile the meaning of the dream has dawned 
upon me. 

I have noted an intention which is realized through 
the dream, 
and which must have been my motive in dreaming. 
 
The dream fulfils several wishes, 
which were awakened within 
me by the events of the previous evening (Otto’s news, 
and the 
writing of the clinical history). 

For the result of the dream is,  
that it is not I who am to blame for the pain which Irma is still 
suffering, 
but that Otto is to blame for it. 

Now Otto has annoyed 
me by his remark about Inna’s imperfect cure;
the dream 
avenges me upon him, 
in that it turns the reproach upon himself. 
 
The dream acquits me of responsibility for Irma’s condition, 
as 
it refers this condition to other causes (which do, 
indeed, 
furnish quite a number of explanations). 

The dream represents a 
certain state of affairs, 
such as I might wish to exist;
the content 
of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish;
its motive is a wish. 
 
This much is apparent at first sight But many other details of 
the dream become intelligible when regarded from the standpoint 
of wish-fulfilment. 

I take my revenge on Otto, 
not merely for 
too readily talcing sides against me, 
in that I accuse him of 
careless medical treatment (the injection), 
but I revenge myself 
also for the bad liqueur which smells of fusel oil, 
and I find an 
expression in the dream which unites both these reproaches: the 
injection of a preparation of propyl. 

Still I am not satisfied, 
but 
continue to avenge myself by comparing him with his more 
reliable colleague. 

Thereby I seem to say: I like him better 
than you. 

But Otto is not the only person who must be made to 
feel the weight of my anger. 

I take my revenge on the disobedient 
patient, 
by exchanging her for a more sensible and more docile 
one. 

Nor do I pass over Dr M’s contradiction;
for I express, 
 
in an obvious allusion, 
my opinion of him: namely, 
that his attitude in this case is that, 
of an ignoramus (Dysentery will develop, 
etc. 

Indeed, 
it seems as though I were appealing from 
him to someone better informed (my friend, 
who told me about 
trimethylamin), 
just as I have turned from Irma to her friend, 
and from Otto to Leopold.
 
It is as though I were to say: Rid me 
of these three persons, 
replace them by three others of my own 
choice, 
and I shall be rid of the reproaches which I am not willing to admit that I deserve! 

In my dream the unreasonableness 
of these reproaches is demonstrated for me in the most elaborate 
manner.

Irma’s pains are not attributable to me, 
since she herself is to blame for them, 
in that she refuses to accept my solution.
They do not concern me, 
for being as they are of an organic 
nature, 
they cannot possibly be cured by psychic treatment.
Irma’s sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her widowhood 
(trimethylamin!);
a state which I cannot alter.

Irma’s illness 
has been caused by an incautious injection administered by Otto,  
an injection of an unsuitable drug, 
such as I should never have 
administered.

Irma’s complaint is the result of an injection 
made with an unclean syringe, 
like the phlebitis of my old lady 
patient, 
whereas my injections have never caused any ill effects.
 
I am aware that these explanations of Irma’s illness, 
which unite 
in acquitting me, 
do not agree with one another;
that they even 
exclude one another.

The whole plea — for this dream is nothing 
else — recalls vividly the defence offered by a man who was accused by his neighbour of having returned a kettle in a damaged 
condition.

In the first place, 
he said, 
he had returned the kettle 
undamaged;
in the second place it already had holes in it when 
he borrowed it;
and in the third place, 
he had never borrowed it 
at all.

A complicated defence, 
but so much the better;
if only 
one of these three lines of defence is recognized as valid, 
the man 
must be acquitted.
 
Still other themes play a part in the dream, 
and their relation 
to my non-responsibility for Irma’s illness is not so apparent: my 
daughter’s illness, 
and that of a patient with the same name;
the 
harmfulness of cocaine;
the affection of my patient, 
who was 
traveling in Egypt;
concern about the health of my wife;
my 
brother, 
and Dr M; 
my own physical troubles, 
and anxiety 
concerning my absent friend, 
who is suffering from suppurative 
rhinitis.

But if I keep all these things in view, 
they combine into 
a single train of thought, 
which might be labelled: concern for 
the health of myself and others;
professional conscientiousness.
 
I recall a vaguely disagreeable feeling when Otto gave me the 
news of Irma’s condition.

Lastly, 
I am inclined, 
after the event, 
to 
find an expression of this fleeting sensation in the train of 
thoughts which forms part of the dream.

It is as though Otto had 
said to me: You do not take your medical duties seriously 
enough;
you are not conscientious;
you do not perform what 
you promise.

Thereupon this train of thought placed itself at 
my service, 
in order that I might give proof of my extreme conscientiousness, 
of my intimate concern about the health of my 
relatives, 
friends and patients.

Curiously enough, 
there are also 
some painful memories in this material, 
which confirm the blame 
attached to Otto rather than my own exculpation.

The material 
is apparently impartial, 
but the connection between this broader 
material, 
on which the dream is based, 
and the more limited 
theme from which emerges the wish to be innocent of Irma’s 
illness, 
is, 
nevertheless, 
unmistakable.
 
I do not wish to assert that I have entirely revealed the meaning of the dream, 
or that my interpretation is flawless.
 
I could still spend much time upon it;
I could draw further 
explanations from it, 
and discuss further problems which it 
seems to propound.

I can even perceive the points from which 
further mental associations might be traced;
but such considerations as are always involved in every dream of one’s own 
prevent me from interpreting it farther.

Those who are overready to condemn such reserve should make the experiment of 
trying to be more straightforward.

For the present I am content 
with the one fresh discovery which has just been made: If the 
method of dream-interpretation here indicated is followed, 
it 
will be found that dreams do really possess a meaning, 
and are 
by no means the expression of a disintegrated cerebral activity, 
as the writers on the subject would have us believe.

When the 
work of interpretation has been completed the dream can be 
recognized as a wish- fulfilment.
 
When, 
after passing through a narrow defile, 
one suddenly 
reaches a height beyond which the ways part and a rich prospect 
lies outspread in different directions, 
it is well to stop for a 
moment and consider whither one shall turn next.

We are in 
somewhat the same position after we have mastered this first 
interpretation of a dream.

We find ourselves standing in the light 
of a sudden discovery.

The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of a musical instrument, 
which, 
instead of being 
played by the hand of a musician, 
is struck by some external 
force;
the dream is not meaningless, 
not absurd, 
does not presuppose that one part of our store of ideas is dormant while 
another part begins to awake.

It is a perfectly valid psychic 
phenomenon, 
actually a wish-fulfilment;
it may be enrolled in 
the continuity of the intelligible psychic activities of the waking 
state;
it is built up by a highly complicated intellectual activity.
 
But at the very moment when we are about to rejoice in this discovery a host of problems besets us.
If the dream, 
as this theory 
defines it, 
represents a fulfilled wish, 
what is the cause of the 
striking and unfamiliar manner in which this fulfilment is expressed? What transformation has occurred in our dreamthoughts before the manifest dream, 
as we remember it on waking, 
shapes itself out of them? How has this transformation taken 
place? Whence comes the material that is worked up into the 
dream? What causes many of the peculiarities which are to be 
observed in our dream-thoughts;
for example, 
how is it that they 
are able to contradict one another? (see the analogy of the kettle, 
Is the dream capable of teaching us something new concerning our internal psychic processes, 
and can its content correct 
opinions which we have held during the day? I suggest that for 
the present all these problems be laid aside, 
and that a single path 
be pursued.

We have found that the dream represents a wish as 
fulfilled.

Our next purpose should be to ascertain whether this 
is a general characteristic of dreams, 
or whether it is only the 
accidental content of the particular dream (the dream about 
Irma’s injection) with which we have begun our analysis;
for 
even if we conclude that every dream has a meaning and psychic 
value, 
we must nevertheless allow for the possibility that this 
meaning may not be the same in every dream.

The first dream 
which we have considered was the fulfilment of a wish;
another 
may turn out to be the realization of an apprehension;
a third 
may have a reflection as its content;
a fourth may simply reproduce a reminiscence.

Are there, 
then, 
dreams other than wishdreams;
or are there none but wish-dreams? 

It is easy to show that the wish-fulfilment in dreams is often undisguised and easy to recognize, 
so that one may wonder why the 
language of dreams has not long since been understood.

There is,  
for example, 
a dream which I can evoke as often as I please, 
experimentally, 
as it were.

If, 
in the evening, 
I eat anchovies,  
olives, 
or other strongly salted foods, 
I am thirsty at night, 
and 
therefore I wake.

The waking, 
however, 
is preceded by a dream,  
which has always the same content, 
namely, 
that I am drinking.
 
I am drinking long draughts of water;
it tastes as delicious as 
only a cool drink can taste when one’s throat is parched;
and 
then I wake, 
and find that I have an actual desire to drink.

The 
cause of this dream is thirst, 
which I perceive when I wake.

From 
this sensation arises the wish to drink, 
and the dream shows me 
this wish as fulfilled.

It thereby serves a function, 
the nature of 
which I soon surmise.

I sleep well, 
and am not accustomed to 
being waked by a bodily need.

If I succeed in appeasing my 
thirst by means of the dream that I am drinking, 
I need not wake 
up in order to satisfy that thirst.

It is thus a dream of convenience.

The dream takes the place of action, 
as elsewhere in 
life.

Unfortunately, 
the need of water to quench the thirst cannot 
be satisfied by a dream, 
as can my thirst for revenge upon Otto 
and Dr M, 
but the intention is the same.

Not long ago I had 
he same dream in a somewhat modified form.

On this occasion 
I felt thirsty before going to bed, 
and emptied the glass of water 
which stood on the little chest beside my bed.

Some hours later,  
during the night, 
my thirst returned, 
with the consequent discomfort.

In order to obtain water, 
I should have had to get up 
and fetch the glass which stood on my wife’s bed-table.

I thus 
quite appropriately dreamt that my wife was giving me a drink 
from a vase;
this vase was an Etruscan cinerary urn, 
which I 
had brought home from Italy, 
and had since given away.

But 
the water in it tasted so salt (apparently on account of the ashes) 
that I was forced to wake.

It may be observed how conveniently 
the dream is capable of arranging matters.

Since the fulfilment 
of a wish is its only purpose, 
it may be perfectly egoistic.

Love of 
comfort is really not compatible with consideration for others.
 
The introduction of the cinerary urn is probably once again the 
fulfilment of a wish;
I regret that I no longer possess this vase; 
it, 
like the glass of water at my wife’s side, 
is inaccessible to me.
 
The cinerary urn is appropriate also in connection with the 
sensation of an increasingly salty taste, 
which I know will compel me to wake. 

Such convenience-dreams came very frequently to me in my 
youth.

Accustomed as I had always been to working until late 
at night, 
early waiting was always a matter of difficulty.

I used 
then to dream that I was out of bed and standing at the washstand.

After a while I could no longer shut out the knowledge 
that I was not yet up;
but in the meantime I had continued to 
sleep.

The same sort of lethargy-dream was dreamed by a young 
colleague of mine, 
who appears to share my propensity for sleep.
 
With him it assumed a particularly amusing form.

The landlady 
with whom he was lodging in the neighbourhood of the hospital 
had strict orders to wake him every morning at a given hour, 
but 
she found it by no means easy to carry out his orders.

One morning sleep was especially sweet to him.

The woman called into his 
room: Herr Pepi, 
get up;
you’ve got to go to the hospital.
 
Whereupon the sleeper dreamt of a room in the hospital, 
of a bed 
in which he was lying, 
and of a chart pinned over his head, 
which 
read as follows: Pepi M, 
medical student, 
22 years of age.

He 
told himself in the dream: If I am already at the hospital, 
I 
don’t have to go there, 
turned over, 
and slept on.

He had thus 
frankly admitted to himself his motive for dreaming.
 
Here is yet another dream of which the stimulus was active 
during sleep: One of my women patients, 
who had been obliged 
to undergo an unsuccessful operation on the jaw, 
was instructed 
by her physicians to wear by day and night a cooling apparatus 
on the affected cheek;
but she was in the habit of throwing it off 
as soon as she had fallen asleep.

One day I was asked to reprove 
her for doing so;
she had again thrown the apparatus on the 
floor.

The patient defended herself as follows: This time I 
really couldn’t help it;
it was the result of a dream which I had 
during the night.

In the dream I was in a box at the opera, 
and 
was taking a lively interest in the performance.

But Herr Karl 
Meyer was lying in the sanatorium and complaining pitifully on 
account of pains in his jaw.

I said to myself, 
Since I haven’t the 
pains, 
I don’t need the apparatus either’;
that’s why I threw it 
away.

The dream of this poor sufferer reminds me of an expression which comes to our lips when we are in a disagreeable situation: Well, 
I can imagine more amusing things! The dream 
presents these more amusing things! Herr Karl Meyer, 
to 
whom the dreamer attributed her pains, 
was the most casual 
acquaintance of whom she could think.

It is quite as simple a matter to discover the wish-fulfilment in 
several other dreams which I have collected from healthy persons.

A friend who was acquainted with my theory of dreams, 
and had explained it to his wife, 
said to me one day: My 
wife asked me to tell you that she dreamt yesterday that she 
was having her menses.

You will know what that means.
Of 
course I know: if the young wife dreams that she is having her 
menses, 
the menses have stopped.

I can well imagine that she 
would have liked to enjoy her freedom a little longer, 
before the 
discomforts of maternity began.

It was a clever way of giving 
notice of her first pregnancy.

Another friend writes that his wife 
had dreamt not long ago that she noticed milk-stains on the front 
of her blouse.

This also is an indication of pregnancy, 
but not 
of the first one;
the young mother hoped she would have more 
nourishment for the second child than she had for the first.
 
A young woman who for weeks had been cut off from all society because she was nursing a child who was suffering from an 
infectious disease dreamt, 
after the child had recovered, 
of a 
company of people in which Alphonse Daudet, 
Paul Bourget,  
Marcel Prevost and others were present;
they were all very 
pleasant to her and amused her enormously.

In her dream these 
different authors had the features which their portraits give 
them.

M Prevost, 
with whose portrait she is not familiar, 
looked 
like the man who had disinfected the sickroom the day before,  
the first outsider to enter it for a long time.

Obviously the dream 
is to be translated thus: It is about time now for something 
more entertaining than this eternal nursing.
 
Perhaps this collection will suffice to prove that frequently, 
and under the most complex conditions, 
dreams may be noted 
which can be understood only as wish-fulfilments, 
and which 
present their content without concealment.

In most cases these 
are short and simple dreams, 
and they stand in pleasant contrast 
to the confused and overloaded dream-compositions which have 
almost exclusively attracted the attention of the writers on the 
subject.

But it will repay us if we give some time to the examination of these simple dreams.
The simplest dreams of all are, 
I suppose, 
to be expected in the case of children whose psychic 
activities are certainly less complicated than those of adults.
 
Child psychology, 
in my opinion, 
is destined to render the same 
services to the psychology of adults as a study of the structure 
or development of the lower animals renders to the investigation 
of the structure of the higher orders of animals.

Hitherto but few 
deliberate efforts have been made to make use of the psychology 
of the child for such a purpose. 

The dreams of little children are often simple fulfilments of 
wishes, 
and for this reason are, 
as compared with the dreams of 
adults, 
by no means interesting.

They present no problem to be 
solved, 
but they are invaluable as affording proof that the dream, 
in its inmost essence, 
is the fulfilment of a wish.

I have been able 
to collect several examples of such dreams from the material 
furnished by my own children.

For two dreams, 
one that of a daughter of mine, 
at that time 
eight and a half years of age, 
and the other that of a boy of five 
and a quarter, 
I am indebted to an excursion to Hallstatt, 
in the 
summer of 1896.

I must first explain that we were living that summer on a hill near Aussee, 
from which, 
when the weather was 
fine, 
we enjoyed a splendid view of the Dachstein.

With a telescope we could easily distinguish the Simony hut.

The children 
often tried to see it through the telescope — I do not know with 
what success.

Before the excursion I had told the children that 
Hallstatt lay at the foot of the Dachstein.

They looked forward 
to the outing with the greatest delight.

From Hallstatt we entered the valley of Eschem, 
which enchanted the children with 
its constantly changing scenery.

One of them, 
however, 
the boy 
of five, 
gradually became discontented.

As often as a mountain 
came into view, 
he would ask: Is that the Dachstein? whereupon I had to reply: No, 
only a foot-hill.

After this question 
had been repeated several times he fell quite silent, 
and did not 
wish to accompany us up the steps leading to the waterfall.

I thought he was tired.

But the next morning he came to me,  
perfectly happy, 
and said: Last night I dreamt that we went 
to the Simony hut.

I understood him now;
he had expected,  
when I spoke of the Dachstein, 
that on our excursion to Hallstatt he would climb the mountain, 
and would see at close 
quarters the hut which had been so often mentioned when the 
telescope was used.

When he learned that he was expected to 
content himself with foot-hills and a waterfall he was disappointed, 
and became discontented.

But the dream compensated 
him for all this.

I tried to learn some details of the dream;
they 
were scanty.

You go up steps for six hours, 
as he had been told. 

On this excursion the girl of eight and a half had likewise 
cherished wishes which had to be satisfied by a dream.

We had 
taken with us to Hallstatt our neighbour’s twelve-year-old boy; 
quite a polished little gentleman, 
who, 
it seemed to me, 
had 
already won the little woman’s sympathies.

Next morning she 
related the following dream: Just think, 
I dreamt that Emil 
was one of the family, 
that he said ‘papa’ and ‘mamma’ to you,  
and slept at our house, 
in the big room, 
like one of the boys.
 
Then mamma came into the room and threw a handful of big 
bars of chocolate, 
wrapped in blue and green paper, 
under our 
beds.

The girl’s brothers, 
who evidently had not inherited an 
understanding of dream-interpretation, 
declared, 
just as the 
writers we have quoted would have done: That dream is nonsense.

The girl defended at least one part of the dream, 
and 
from the standpoint of the theory of the neuroses it is interesting 
to learn which part it was that she defended: That Emil was 
one of the family was nonsense, 
but that part about the bars 
of chocolate wasn’t.

It was just this latter part that was obscure 
to me, 
until my wife furnished the explanation.

On the way home 
from the railway-station the children had stopped in front of a 
slot-machine, 
and had wanted exactly such bars of chocolate,  
wrapped in paper with a metallic lustre, 
such as the machine,  
in their experience, 
provided.

But the mother thought, 
and 
rightly so, 
that the day had brought them enough wish-fulfilments, 
and therefore left this wish to be satisfied in the dream.
 
This little scene had escaped me.

That portion of the dream 
which had been condemned by my daughter I understood without any difficulty.

I myself had heard the well-behaved little 
guest enjoining the children, 
as they were walking ahead of us,  
to wait until ‘papa’ or ‘mamma’ had come up.

For the little girl 
the dream turned this temporary relationship into a permanent 
adoption.

Her affection could not as yet conceive of any other 
way of enjoying her friend’s company permanently than the 
adoption pictured in her dream, 
which was suggested by her 
brothers.

Why the bars of chocolate were thrown under the bed 
could not, 
of course, 
be explained without questioning the child.
 
From a friend I have learned of a dream very much like that 
of my little boy.

It was dreamed by a little girl of eight.

Her 
father, 
accompanied by several children, 
had started on a walk 
to Dornbach, 
with the intention of visiting the Rohrcr hut, 
but 
had turned back, 
as it was growing late, 
promising the children 
to take them some other time.

On the way bade they passed a 
signpost which pointed to the Hameau.

The children now asked 
him to take them to the Hameau, 
but once more, 
and for the 
same reason, 
they had to be content with the promise that they 
should go there some other day.

Next morning the little girl 
went to her father and told him, 
with a satisfied air: Papa, 
I 
dreamed last night that you were with us at the Rohrer hut, 
and 
on the Hameau.

Thus, 
in the dream her impatience had anticipated the fulfilment of the promise made by her father.
 

Another dream, 
with which the picturesque beauty of the 
Aussee inspired my daughter, 
at that time three and a quarter 
years of age, 
is equally straightforward.
 
The little girl had 
crossed the lake for the first time, 
and the trip had passed too 
quickly for her.

She did not want to leave the boat at the lauding, 
and cried bitterly.

The next morning she told us: Last night 
I was sailing on the lake.

Let us hope that the duration of this 
dream-voyage was more satisfactory to her. 

My eldest boy, 
at that time eight years of age, 
was already 
dreaming of the realization of his fancies.

He had ridden in a 
chariot with Achilles, 
with Diomedes as charioteer.

On the previous day he had shown a lively interest in a book on the myths 
of Greece which had been given to his elder sister.

If it can be admitted that the talking of children in their sleep 
belongs to the sphere of dreams, 
I can relate the following as 
one of the earliest dreams in my collection: My youngest daughter, 
at that time nineteen months old, 
vomited one morning, 
and 
was therefore kept without food all day.

During the night she 
was heard to call excitedly in her sleep: Anna F(r)eud, 
sfawbewy, 
wild st’awbewy, 
om’lette, 
pap l She used her name 
in this way in order to express the act of appropriation;
the 
menu presumably included everything that would seem to her a 
desirable meal;
the fact that two varieties of strawberry appeared in it was a demonstration against the sanitary regulations 
of the household, 
and was based on the circumstance, 
which she 
had by no means overlooked, 
that the nurse had ascribed her 
indisposition to an over-plentiful consumption of strawberries;
 
so in her dream she avenged herself for this opinion which met 
with her disapproval.

When we call childhood happy because it does not yet know 
sexual desire, 
we must not forget what a fruitful source of disappointment and renunciation, 
and therefore of dream-stimulation, 
the other great vital impulse may be for the child.

Here is 
a second example.

My nephew, 
twenty-two months of age, 
had 
been instructed to congratulate me on my birthday, 
and to give 
me a present of a small basket of cherries, 
which at that time of 
the year were scarce, 
being hardly in season.

He seemed to find 
the task a difficult one, 
for he repeated again and again: Cherries in it, 
and could not be induced to let the little basket go out 
of his hands.

But he knew how to indemnify himself.
He had, 
until then, 
been in the habit of telling his mother every morning 
that he had dreamt of the white soldier, 
an officer of the guard 
in a white cloak, 
whom he had once admired in the street.

On 
the day after the sacrifice on my birthday he woke up joyfully 
with the announcement, 
which could have referred only to a 
dream: Herman eaten all the cherries 
What animals dream of I do not know.

A proverb for which 
I am indebted to one of my pupils professes to tell us, 
for it asks 
the question: What does the goose dream of? 
and answers: 
ape may be shown by the examples in my Analyse der Phobic cities jim fjahrigen Knaben ( Jahrbuch von Flculcr-Frcud, 
vol, 
i, 
1909), 
anti Jung’s 
Experiences Concerning the Psychic Life of the Child, 
translated by Brill,  
American Journal of Psychology, 
April, 
1910, 
For analytically interpreted 
dreams of children, 
see also von Hug-Hdlmuth, 
Putnam, 
Raalte, 
Spiclrcin, 
and Tausk;
others by Banchieri, 
Busemann, 
Doglia, 
and especially Wigaiu,  
who emphasizes the wish-fulfilling tendency of such dreams, 
On the other 
hand, 
it seems that dreams of an infantile type reappear with especial frequency in adults who are transferred into the midst of unfamiliar conditions.
Thus Otto Nordcnskjold, 
in his book, 
Antarctic (1904, 
vol,
i,  
writes as follows of the crew who spent the winter with him;
Very characteristic of the trend of our inmost thoughts were our dreams, 
which were 
never more vivid and more numerous.

Even those of our comrades with 
whom dreaming was formerly exceptional had long stories to tell in the 
morning, 
when we exchanged our experiences in the world of phantasy.
 
They all had reference to that outside world which was now so far removed 
from us, 
but they often fitted into our immediate circumstances.
An especially characteristic dream was that in which one of our comrades believed 
himself back at school, 
where the task was assigned to him of skinning 
miniature seals, 
which were manufactured especially for purposes of instruction.

Eating and drinking constituted the pivot around which most of 
our dreams revolved.

One of us, 
who was especially fond of going to big 
dinner-parties, 
was delighted if he could report in the morning ‘that he had 
had a three-course dinner.

Another dreamed of tobacco, 
whole mountains 
of tobacco;
yet another dreamed of a ship approaching on the open sea 
under full sail.

Still another dream deserves to be mentioned;
The postman 
brought the post and gave a long explanation of why it was so long delayed;
he had delivered it at the wrong address, 
and only with great trouble 
was he able to get it back.

To be sure, 
we were often occupied in our sleep 
with still more impossible things, 
but the lack of phantasy in almost all the 
dreams which I myself dreamed, 
or heard others relate, 
was quite striking.

It would certainly have been of great psychological interest if all 
these dreams could have been recorded.

But one can readily understand 
how we longed for sleep.

That alone could afford us everything that we all 
most ardently desired.

I will continue by a quotation from Du Prel (p. 
231) : Mungo Park, 
nearly dying of thirst on one of his African expeditions, 
dreamed constantly of the well-watered valleys and meadows of his 
home.

Similarly Trenck, 
tortured by hunger in the fortress of Magdeburg, 
saw himself surrounded by copious meals.
And George Back, 
a member of 
Franklin’s first expedition, 
when he was on the point of death by starvation, 
dreamed continually and invariably of plenteous meals.
 
Of maize.

The whole theory that the dream is the fulfilment of 
a wish is contained in these two sentences. 

We now perceive that we should have reached our theory of 
the hidden meaning of dreams by the shortest route had we 
merely consulted the vernacular.
Proverbial wisdom, 
it is true,  
often speaks contemptuously enough of dreams — it apparently 
seeks to justify the scientists when it says that dreams are bubbles;
but in colloquial language the dream is predominantly 
the gracious fulfiller of wishes.

I should never have imagined 
that in my wildest dreams, 
we exclaim in delight if we find that 
the reality surpasses our expectations.

DISTORTION IN DREAMS 


Jr i now declare that wish-fulfilment is the meaning of every 
dream, 
 so that there cannot be any dreams other than wishdreams, 
 I know beforehand that I shall meet with the most 
emphatic contradiction.
 My critics will object: The fact that 
there are dreams which are to be understood as fulfilments of 
wishes is not new, 
 but has long since been recognized by such 
writers as Radestock, 
 Volkelt, 
 Purkinje, 
 Griesinger and others.
 1 
That there can be no other dreams than those of wish-fulfilments 
isyetone more unjustified generalization;
 which, 
 fortunately, 
 can 
be easily refuted.
 Dreams which present the most painful content, 
 and not the least trace of wish-fulfilment, 
 occur frequently 
enough.
 The pessimistic philosopher, 
 Eduard von Hartmann, 
 is 
perhaps most completely opposed to the theory of wish-fulfilment.
 In his Philosophy of the Unconscious , 
 Part II (Stereotyped German edition, 
 s.
 344), 
 he says: ‘As regards the dream, 
 
with it all the troubles of waking life pass over into the sleeping 
state;
 all save the one thing which may in some degree reconcile 
the cultured person with life — scientific and artistic enjoyment.
 
.
 .
 .
’ But even less pessimistic observers have emphasized the 
fact that in our dreams pain and disgust are more frequent than 
pleasure (Scholz, 
 p.
 33 ;
 Volkelt, 
 p.
 80, 
 ef at .
) .
 Two ladies, 
 Sarah 
Weed and Florence Hallam, 
 have even worked out, 
 on the basis 
of their dreams, 
 a numerical value for the preponderance of 
distress and discomfort in dreams.
 They find that 58 per cent, 
 of 
dreams are disagreeable, 
 and only 28.
6 per cent, 
 positively 
pleasant.
 Besides those dreams that convey into our sleep the 
many painful emotions of life, 
 there are also anxiety- dreams, 
 in 
which this most terrible of all the painful emotions torments us 
until we wake.
 Now it is precisely by these anxiety-dreams that 
children are so often haunted (cf.
 Debacker on Pavor nocturnus ) ;
 
and yet it was in children that you found the wish-fulfilment 
dream in its most obvious form.
 

The anxiety-dream does really seem to preclude a generalization of the thesis deduced from the examples given in the last 
chapter, 
 that dreams are wish-fulfilments, 
 and even to condemn 
it as an absurdity.
 

Nevertheless, 
 it is not difficult to parry these apparently invincible objections.
 It is merely necessary to observe that our 
doctrine is not based upon the estimates of the obvious dreamcontent, 
 but relates to the thought-content, 
 which, 
 in the course 
of interpretation, 
 is found to lie behind the dream.
 Let us compare and contrast the manifest and the latent dream-content .
 It 
is true that there are dreams the manifest content of which is of 
the most painful nature.
 But has anyone ever tried to interpret 
these dreams — to discover their latent thought-content? If not, 
 
the two objections to our doctrine are no longer valid;
 for there 
is always the possibility that even our painful and terrifying 
dreams may, 
 upon interpretation, 
 prove to be wish- fulfilments, 
 2 * * * * * * 

2 It is quite incredible with what obstinancy readers and critics have ex
cluded this consideration and disregarded the fundamental differentiation 

between the manifest and the latent dream-content.
 Nothing in the litera
ture of the subject approaches so closely to my own conception of dreams 
as a passage in J.
 Sully’s essay: Dreams as a Revelation (and it is not be
cause I do not think it valuable that 1 allude to it here for the first time) .
 
It would seem then, 
 after all, 
 that dreams are not the utter nonsense they 
have been said to be by such authorities as Chaucer, 
 Shakespeare, 
 and 
Milton.
 The chaotic aggregations of our night-fancy have a significance and 

communicate new knowledge.
 Like some letter in cipher, 
 the dream-inscrip
tion when scrutinized closely loses its first look of balderdash and takes 
on the aspect of a serious, 
 intelligible message.
 Or, 
 to vary the figure 
slightly, 
 we may say that, 
 like some pamphlets the dream discloses beneath 

its worthless surface-characters traces of an old and precious communication 9 * (p.
 364).
 


46 THE INTERPRETATION OP DREAMS 

In scientific research it is often advantageous, 
 if the solution 
of one problem presents difficulties, 
 to add to it a second problem;
 just as it is easier to crack two nuts together instead of 
separately.
 Thus, 
 we are confronted not only with the problem: 
How can painful and terrifying dreams be the fulfilments of 
wishes? but we may add to this a second problem which arises 
from the foregoing discussion of the general problem of the 
dream: Why do not the dreams that show an indifferent conteut, 
 
and yet turn out to be wish-fulfilments, 
 reveal their meaning 
without disguise? Take the exhaustively treated dream of Irma’s 
injection: it is by no means of a painful character, 
 and it may 
be recognized, 
 upon interpretation, 
 as a striking wish-fulfilment.
 
But why is an interpretation necessary at all? Why does not the 
dream say directly what it means? As a matter of fact, 
 the dream 
of Irma’s injection does not at first produce the impression that 
it represents a wish of the dreamer’s as fulfilled.
 The reader will 
not have received this impression, 
 and even I myself was not 
aware of the fact until I had undertaken the analysis.
 If we call 
this peculiarity of dreams — namely, 
 that they need elucidation 
— the phenomenon of distortion in dreams, 
 a second question 
then arises: What is the origin of this distortion in dreams? 

If one’s first thoughts on this subject were consulted several 
possible solutions might suggest themselves: for example, 
 that 
during sleep one is incapable of finding an adequate expression 
for one’s dream-thoughts.
 The analysis of certain dreams, 
 however, 
 compels us to offer another explanation.
 I shall demonstrate 
this by means of a second dream of my own, 
 which again involves 
numerous indiscretions, 
 but which compensates for this personal 
sacrifice by affording a thorough elucidation of the problem.
 

Preliminary Statement .
 — In the spring of 1897 I learnt that 
two professors of our university had proposed me for the title of 
Professor Extraordinarius (assistant professor) .
 The news came 
as a surprise to me, 
 and pleased me considerably as an expression 
of appreciation on the part of two eminent men which could not 
be explained by personal interest.
 But I told myself immediately 
that I must not expect anything to come of their proposal.
 For 
some years past the Ministry had disregarded such proposals, 
 
and several colleagues of mine, 
 who were my seniors, 
 and at 
*east my equals in desert, 
 had been waiting in vain all this time 
for the appointment.
 I had no reason to suppose that I should 
fare any better.
 I resolved, 
 therefore, 
 to resign myself to disappointment.
 I am not, 
 so far as I know, 
 ambitious, 
 and I was following my profession with gratifying success even without the 
recommendation of a professorial title.
 Whether I considered 
the grapes to be sweet or sour did not matter, 
 since they undoubtedly hung too high for me.
 

One evening a friend of mine called to see me;
 one of those 
colleagues whose fate I had regarded as a warning.
 As he had 
long been a candidate for promotion to the professorate (which 
in our society makes the doctor a demigod to his patients), 
 and 
as he was less resigned than I, 
 he was accustomed from time to 
time to remind the authorities of his claims in the hope of advancing his interests.
 It was after one of these visits that he 
called on me.
 He said that this time he had driven the exalted 
gentleman into a corner, 
 and had asked him frankly whether 
considerations of religious denomination were not really responsible for the postponement of his appointment.
 The answer was: 
His Excellency had to admit that in the present state of public 
opinion he was not in a position, 
 etc.
 Now at least I know 
where I stand/ 7 my friend concluded his narrative, 
 which told 
me nothing new, 
 but which was calculated to confirm me in my 
resignation.
 For the same denominational considerations would 
apply to my own case.
 

On the morning after my friend’s visit I had the following 
dream, 
 which was notable also on account of its form.
 It consisted of two thoughts and two images, 
 so that a thought and an 
image emerged alternately.
 But here I shall record only the 
first half of the dream, 
 since the second half has no relation to the 
purpose for which I cite the dream.
 

I.
 My friend R.
 is my uncle — I have a great affection for him .
 
II.
 I see before me his face , 
 somewhat altered .
 It seems to be 
elongated;
 a yellow beard , 
 which surrounds it, 
 is seen with 
peculiar distinctness .
 

Then follow the other two portions of the dream, 
 again a 
thought and an image, 
 which I omit.
 



48 THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS 

The interpretation of this dream was arrived at in the following manner: 

When I recollected the dream in the course of the morning, 
 I 
laughed outright and said, 
 The dream is nonsense.
 But I could 
not get it out of my mind, 
 and I was pursued by it all day, 
 
until at least, 
 in the evening, 
 I reproached myself in these words: 
If in the course of a dream-interpretation one of your patients 
could find nothing better to say than ‘That is nonsense, 
’ you 
would reprove him, 
 and you would suspect that behind the 
dream there was hidden some disagreeable affair, 
 the exposure of 
which he wanted to spare himself.
 Apply the same thing to your 
own case;
 your opinion that the dream is nonsense probably signifies merely an inner resistance to its interpretation.
 Don’t let 
yourself be put off.
 I then proceeded with the interpretation.
 

R.
 is my uncle.
 What can that mean? I had only one uncle, 
 
my uncle Joseph.
 3 His story, 
 to be sure, 
 was a sad one.
 Once, 
 
more than thirty years ago, 
 hoping to make money, 
 he allowed 
himself to be involved in transactions of a kind which the law 
punishes severely, 
 and paid the penalty.
 My father, 
 whose hair 
turned grey with grief within a few days, 
 used always to say that 
unde Joseph had never been a bad man, 
 but, 
 after all, 
 he was 
a simpleton.
 If, 
 then, 
 my friend R.
 is my uncle Joseph, 
 that is 
equivalent to saying: R.
 is a simpleton.
 Hardly credible, 
 and 
very disagreeable I But there is the face that I saw in the dream, 
 
with its elongated features and its yellow beard.
 My uncle actually had such a face — long, 
 and framed in a handsome yellow 
beard.
 My friend R.
 was extremely swarthy, 
 but when blackhaired people begin to grow grey they pay for the glory of their 
youth.
 Their black beards undergo an unpleasant change of colour, 
 hair by hair;
 first they turn a reddish brown, 
 then a yellowish brown, 
 and then definitely grey.
 My friend R.
’s beard is now 
in this stage;
 so, 
 for that matter, 
 is my own, 
 a fact which I note 
with regret.
 The face that I see in my dream is at once that of 

3 It is astonishing to sfie how my memory here restricts itself — in the 
waking state! — for the purposes of analysis.
 I have known five of my 
uncles and I loved and honoured one of them.
 But at the moment when 
I overcame my resistance to the interpretation of the dream, 
 I said to myself: I have only one unde, 
 the one who is intended in the dream.
 
my friend R.
 and that of my uncle.
 It is like one of those composite photographs of Gal ton’s;
 in order to emphasize family 
resemblances Galton had several faces photographed on the same 
plate.
 No doubt is now possible;
 it is really my opinion that my 
friend R.
 is a simpleton — like my uncle Joseph.
 

I have still no idea for what purpose I have worked out this 
relationship.
 It is certainly one to which I must unreservedly 
object.
 Yet it is not very profound, 
 for my uncle was a criminal, 
 
and my friend R.
 is not, 
 except in so far as he was once fined for 
knocking down an apprentice with his bicycle.
 Can I be thinking 
of this offence? That would make the comparison ridiculous.
 
Here I recollect another conversation, 
 which I had some days 
ago with another colleague, 
 N.
;
 as a matter of fact, 
 on the same 
subject.
 I met N.
 in the street;
 he, 
 too, 
 has been nominated for 
a professorship, 
 and having heard that I had been similarly honoured he congratulated me.
 I refused his congratulations, 
 saying: 
You are the last man to jest about the matter, 
 for you know 
from your own experience what the nomination is worth.
 Thereupon he said, 
 though probably not in earnest: You can’t be 
sure of that.
 There is a special objection in my case.
 Don’t you 
know that a woman once brought a criminal accusation against 
me? I need hardly assure you that the matter was put right.
 It 
was a mean attempt at blackmail, 
 and it was all I could do to save 
the plaintiff from punishment.
 But it may be that the affair is 
remembered against me at the Ministry.
 You, 
 on the other hand, 
 
are above reproach.
 Here, 
 then, 
 I have the criminal, 
 and at the 
same time the interpretation and tendency of my dream.
 My 
uncle Joseph represents both of my colleagues who have not been 
appointed to the professorship — the one as a simpleton, 
 the other 
as a criminal.
 Now, 
 too, 
 I know for what purpose I need this representation.
 If denominational considerations are a determining 
factor in the postponement of my two friends’ appointment, 
 then 
my own appointment is likewise in jeopardy.
 But if I can refer 
the rejection of my two friends to other causes, 
 which do not 
apply to my own case, 
 my hopes are unaffected.
 This is the procedure followed by my dream: it makes the one friend, 
 R.
, 
 a 
simpleton, 
 and the other, 
 N.
, 
 a criminal.
 But since I am neither 
one nor the other, 
 there is nothing in common between us.
 I have 
a right to enjoy my appointment to the title of professor, 
 and 
have avoided the distressing application to my own case of the 
information which the official gave to my friend R.
 

I must pursue the interpretation of this dream still farther;
 
for I have a feeling that it is not yet satisfactorily elucidated.
 X 
still feel disquieted by the ease with which I have degraded two 
respected colleagues in order to clear my own way to the professorship.
 My dissatisfaction with this procedure has, 
 of course, 
 
been mitigated since I have learned to estimate the testimony 
of dreams at its true value.
 I should contradict anyone who suggested that I really considered R.
 a simpleton, 
 or that I did not 
believe N.
’s account of the blackmailing incident.
 And of course 
I do not believe that Irma has been made seriously ill by an injection of a preparation of propyl administered by Otto.
 Here, 
 as 
before, 
 what the dream expresses is only my wish that things 
might be so.
 The statement in which my wish is realized sounds 
less absurd in the second dream than in the first;
 it is here made 
with a skilful use of actual points of support in establishing something like a plausible slander, 
 one of which one could say that 
there is something in it.
 For at that time my friend R.
 had to 
contend with the adverse vote of a university professor of his 
own department, 
 and my friend N.
 had himself, 
 all suspcctingly, 
 
provided me with material for the calumny.
 Nevertheless, 
 I repeat, 
 it still seems to me that the dream requires further elucidation.
 

I remember now that the dream contained yet another portion 
which has hitherto been ignored by the interpretation.
 After it 
occurred to me that my friend R.
 was my uncle, 
 I felt in the 
dream a great affection for him.
 To whom is this feeling directed? 
For my uncle Joseph, 
 of course, 
 I have never had any feelings 
of affection.
 R.
 has for many years been a dearly loved friend, 
 
but if X were to go to him and express my affection for him in 
terms approaching the degree of affection which I felt in the 
dream, 
 he would undoubtedly be surprised.
 My affection, 
 if it 
was for him, 
 seems false and exaggerated, 
 as does my judgment 
of his intellectual qualities, 
 which I expressed by merging his 
personality in that of my uncle;
 but exaggerated in the opposite 
direction.
 Now, 
 however, 
 a new state of affairs dawns upon me.
 

The affection in the dream does not belong to the latent content, 
 
to the thoughts behind the dream;
 it stands in opposition to this 
content;
 it is calculated to conceal the knowledge conveyed by 
the interpretation.
 Probably this is precisely its function.
 I remember with what reluctance I undertook the interpretation, 
 
how long I tried to postpone it, 
 and how I declared the dream to 
be sheer nonsense.
 I know from my psychoanalytic practice how 
such a condemnation is to be interpreted.
 It has no informative 
value, 
 but merely expresses an affect.
 If my little daughter does 
not like an apple which is offered her, 
 she asserts that the apple 
is bitter, 
 without even tasting it.
 If my patients behave thus, 
 I 
know that we are dealing with an idea which they are trying to 
repress.
 The same thing applies to my dream.
 I do not want 
to interpret it because there is something in the interpretation to 
which I object.
 After the interpretation of the dream is completed, 
 I discover what it was to which I objected;
 it was the 
assertion that R.
 is a simpleton.
 I can refer the affection which 
I feel for R.
 not to the latent dream-thoughts, 
 but rather to this 
unwillingness of mine.
 If my dream, 
 as compared with its latent 
content, 
 is disguised at this point, 
 and actually misrepresents 
things by producing their opposites, 
 then the manifest affection 
in the dream serves the purpose of the misrepresentation;
 in 
other words, 
 the distortion is here shown to be intentional — it is 
a means of disguise.
 My dream-thoughts of R.
 are derogatory, 
 
and so that I may not become aware of this the very opposite of 
defamation — a tender affection for him — enters into the dream.
 

This discovery may prove to be generally valid.
 As the examples in Chapter III have demonstrated, 
 there are, 
 of course, 
 
dreams which are undisguised wish-fulfilments.
 Wherever a 
wish-fulfilment is unrecognizable and disguised there must be 
present a tendency to defend oneself against this wish, 
 and in 
consequence of this defence the wish is unable to express itself 
save in a distorted form.
 I will try to find a parallel in social life 
to this occurrence in the inner psychic life.
 Where in social life 
can a similar misrepresentation be found? Only where two persons are concerned, 
 one of whom possesses a certain power while 
the other has to act with a certain consideration on account of 
this power.
 The second person will then distort his psychic actions;

or, 
 as we say, 
 he will mask himself.
 The politeness which I 
practise every day is largely a disguise of this kind;
 if I interpret 
my dreams for the benefit of my readers, 
 I am forced to make 
misrepresentations of this kind.
 The poet even complains of the 
necessity of such misrepresentation: Das Bcstc , 
 was du wisscn 
kannst, 
 darfst du den Bubcn dock nicht sagcn;
 The best that 
thou canst know thou mayst not tell to boys.
 

The political writer who has unpleasant truths to tell to those 
in power finds himself in a like position.
 If he tells everything 
without reserve, 
 the Government will suppress them — retrospectively in the case of a verbal expression of opinion, 
 preventively 
if they are to be published in the Press.
 The writer stands in fear 
of the censorship;
 he therefore moderates and disguises the expression of his opinions.
 He finds himself compelled, 
 in accordance with the sensibilities of the censor, 
 either to refrain altogether from certain forms of attack, 
 or to express himself in 
allusions instead of by direct assertions;
 or he must conceal his 
objectionable statement in an apparently innocent disguise.
 He 
may, 
 for instance, 
 tell of a contretemps between two Chinese 
mandarins, 
 while he really has in mind the officials of his own 
country.
 The stricter the domination of the censorship, 
 the more 
thorough becomes the disguise, 
 and, 
 often enough, 
 the more ingenious the means employed to put the reader on the track of 
the actual meaning.
 

The detailed correspondence between the phenomena of censorship and the phenomena of dream-distortion justifies us in 
presupposing similar conditions for both.
 We should then assume 
that in every human being there exist, 
 as the primary cause of 
dream formation, 
 two psychic forces (tendencies or systems), 
 
one of which forms the wish expressed by the dream, 
 while the 
other exercises a censorship over this dream-wish, 
 thereby enforcing on it a distortion.
 The question is, 
 what is the nature 
of the authority of this second agency by virtue of which it is 
able to exercise its censorship? If we remember that the latent 
dream-thoughts are not conscious before analysis, 
 but that the 
manifest dream-content emerging from them is consciously remembered, 
 it is not a far-fetched assumption that admittance to 
the consciousness is the prerogative of the second agency.
 Nothing
 can reach the consciousness from the first system which has 
not previously passed the second instance;
 and the second instance lets nothing pass without exercising its rights, 
 and forcing 
such modifications as are pleasing to itself upon the candidates 
for admission to consciousness.
 Here we arrive at a very definite 
conception of the essence of consciousness;
 for us the state 
of becoming conscious is a special psychic act, 
 different from and 
independent of the process of becoming fixed or represented, 
 and 
consciousness appears to us as a sensory organ which perceives 
a content proceeding from another source.
 It may be shown 
that psychopathology simply cannot dispense with these fundamental assumptions.
 But we shall reserve for another time 
a more exhaustive examination of the subject.
 

If I bear in mind the notion of the two psychic instances and 
their relation to the consciousness, 
 I find in the sphere of politics 
a perfectly appropriate analogy to the extraordinary affection 
which I feel for my friend R.
, 
 who is so disparaged in the dreaminterpretation.
 I refer to the political life of a State in which the 
ruler, 
 jealous of his rights, 
 and an active public opinion are in 
mutual conflict.
 The people, 
 protesting against the actions of an 
unpopular official, 
 demand his dismissal.
 The autocrat, 
 on the 
other hand, 
 in order to show his contempt for the popular will, 
 
may then deliberately confer upon the official some exceptional 
distinction which otherwise would not have been conferred.
 
Similarly, 
 my second instance, 
 controlling the access to my consciousness, 
 distinguishes my friend R.
 with a rush of extraordinary affection, 
 because the wish-tendencies of the first system, 
 
in view of a particular interest on which they are just then intent, 
 would like to disparage him as a simpleton.


We may now perhaps begin to suspect that dream-interpretation is capable of yielding information concerning the structure 
of our psychic apparatus which we have hitherto vainly expected 
from philosophy.
 We shall not, 
 however, 
 follow up this trail, 
 
but shall return to our original problem as soon as we have elucidated the problem of dream-distortion.
 The question arose, 
 how 
dreams with a disagreeable content can be analysed as wish-fulfilments.
 We see now that this is possible where a dream-distortion has occurred, 
 when the disagreeable content serves only to 
disguise the thing wished for.
 With regard to our assumptions 
respecting the two psychic instances, 
 we can now also say that 
disagreeable dreams contain, 
 as a matter of fact, 
 something 
which is disagreeable to the second instance, 
 but which at the 
same time fulfils a wish of the first instance.
 They are wishdreams in so far as every dream emanates from the first instance, 
 
while the second instance behaves towards the dream only in a 
defensive, 
 not in a constructive manner .
 5 Were we to limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second instance contributes 
to the dream we should never understand the dream, 
 and all the 
problems which the writers on the subject have discovered in the 
dream would have to remain unsolved.
 

That the dream actually has a secret meaning, 
 which proves 
to be a wish-fulfilment, 
 must be proved afresh in every case by 
analysis.
 I will therefore select a few dreams which have painful 
contents, 
 and endeavour to analyse them.
 Some of them are 
dreams of hysterical subjects, 
 which therefore call for a long 
preliminary statement, 
 and in some passages an examination of .
 
the psychic processes occurring in hysteria.
 This, 
 though it will 
complicate the presentation, 
 is unavoidable.
 

When I treat a psychoneurotic patient analytically, 
 his dreams 
regularly, 
 as I have said, 
 become a theme of our conversations.
 

I must therefore give him all the psychological explanations with 
whose aid I myself have succeeded in understanding his symptoms.

And here I encounter unsparing criticism, 
 which is perhaps 
no less shrewd than that which I have to expect from my colleagues.
 With perfect uniformity my patients contradict the doctrine that dreams are the fulfilments of wishes.
 Here are several 
examples of the sort of dream-material which is adduced in refutation of my theory.
 

You are always saying that a dream is a wish fulfilled, 
 begins an intelligent lady patient.
 Now I shall tell you a dream in 
which the content is quite the opposite, 
 in which a wish of mine 
is not fulfilled.
 How do you reconcile that with your theory? The 
dream was as follows: l want to give a supper , 
 but I have nothing 
available except some smoked salmon .
 I think I will go shopping , 
 
but 1 remember that it is Sunday afternoon when all the shops 
are closed .
 I then try to ring up a few caterers , 
 but the telephone 
is out of order.
 Accordingly I have to renounce my desire to give 
a supper 

I reply, 
 of course, 
 that only the analysis can decide the meaning of this dream, 
 although I admit that at first sight it seems 
sensible and coherent and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfilment, 
 But what occurrence gave rise to this dream? I ask.
 
You know that the stimulus of a dream always lies among the 
experiences of the preceding day.
 

Analysis.
 — The patient’s husband, 
 an honest and capable meat 
salesman, 
 had told her the day before that he was growing too 
fat, 
 and that he meant to undergo treatment for obesity.
 He 
would rise early, 
 take physical exercise, 
 keep to a strict diet, 
 and 
above all accept no more invitations to supper.
 — She proceeds 
jestingly to relate how her husband, 
 at a table d'hote , 
 had made 
the acquaintance of an artist, 
 who insisted upon painting his 
portrait, 
 because he, 
 the painter, 
 had never seen such an expressive head.
 But her husband had answered in his downright fashion, 
 that while he was much obliged, 
 he would rather not be 
painted;
 and he was quite convinced that a bit of a pretty 
young girl’s posterior would please the artist better than his 
whole face.
 6 — She is very much in love with her husband, 
 and 
teases him a good deal.
 She has asked him not to give her any 
caviar.
 What can that mean? 

As a matter of fact, 
 she had wanted for a long time to eat a 
caviar sandwich every morning, 
 but had grudged the expense.
 
Of course she could get the caviar from her husband at once if 
she asked for it.
 But she has, 
 on the contrary, 
 begged him not to 
give her any caviar, 
 so that she might tease him about it a little 
longer.
 

(To me this explanation seems thin.
 Unconfessed motives are 
wont to conceal themselves behind just such unsatisfying explanations.
 We are reminded of the subjects hypnotized by Bernheim, 
 who carried out a post-hypnotic order, 
 and who, 
 on being 
questioned as to their motives, 
 instead of answering: I do not 
know why I did that, 
 had to invent a reason that was obviously 
inadequate.
 There is probably something similar to this in the 
case of my patient’s caviar.
 I see that in waking life she is compelled to invent an unfulfilled wish.
 Her dream also shows her 
the non-fulfilment of her wish.
 But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?) 

The ideas elicited so far are insufficient for the interpretation of the dream.
 I press for more.
 After a short pause, 
 which 
corresponds to the overcoming of a resistance, 
 she reports that 
the day before she had paid a visit to a friend of whom she is 
really jealous because her husband is always praising this lady 
so highly.
 Fortunately this friend is very thin and lanky, 
 and 
her husband likes full figures.
 Now of what did this thin friend 
speak? Of course, 
 of her wish to become rather plumper.
 She 
also asked my patient: When are you going to invite us again? 
You always have such good food.
 

Now the meaning of the dream is clear.
 I am able to tdl the 
patient: It is just as though you had thought at the moment 
of her asking you that: ‘Of course, 
 I’m to invite you so that you 
can eat at my house and get fat and become still more pleasing 
to my husband 1 I would rather give no more suppers 1’ The 
dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, 
 thereby fulfilling your wish not to contribute anythng to the rounding out of 
your friend’s figure.
 Your husband’s resolution to accept no 
more invitations to supper in order that he may grow thin 
teaches you that one grows fat on food eaten at other people’s 
tables.
 Nothing is lacking now but some sort of coincidence 
which will confirm the solution.
 The smoked salmon in the dream 
has not yet been traced.
 — How did you come to thinV 0 f salmon 
in your dream? — Smoked salmon is my friend’s favorite rli^h » 
she replied.
 It happens that I know the lady, 
 and am able to 
affirm that she grudges herself salmon just as my patient grudges 
herself caviar.
 

This dream admits of yet another and more exact interpretation — one which is actually necessitated only by a sub sidiar y 
circumstance.
 The two interpretations do not contradict one 
another, 
 but rather dovetail into one another, 
 and fur nish an 
excellent example of the usual ambiguity of dre ams , 
 as of all 
other psychopathological formations.
 We have heard tha t a t 
the time of her dream of a denied wish the patient was impelled to 
deny herself a real wish (the wish to eat caviar sandwiches).
 Her 
friend, 
 too, 
 had expressed a wish, 
 namely, 
 to get fatter, 
 and it 
would not surprise us if our patient had dreamt that this wish of 
her friend’s — the wish to increase in weight— was not to be fulfilled.
 Instead of this, 
 however, 
 she dreamt that one of her own 
wishes was not fulfilled.
 The dream becomes capable of a new 
interpretation if in the dream she does not mean herself, 
 but 
her friend, 
 if she has put herself in the place of her friend, 
 or, 
 
as we may say, 
 has identified herself with her friend.
 

I think she has actually done this, 
 and as a sign of this identification she has created for herself in real life an unfulfilled wish.
 
But what is the meaning of this hysterical identification? To 
elucidate this a more exhaustive exposition is necessary.
 Identification is a highly important motive in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms;
 by this means patients are enabled to express 
in their symptoms not merely their own experiences, 
 but the experiences of quite a number of other persons;
 they can suffer, 
 
as it were, 
 for a whole mass of people, 
 and fill all the parts of a 
drama with their own personalities.
 It will here be objected that 
this is the well-known hysterical imitation, 
 the ability of hysterical subjects to imitate all the symptoms which impress them 
when they occur in others, 
 as though pity were aroused to the 
point of reproduction.
 This, 
 however, 
 only indicates the path 
which the psychic process follows in hysterical imitation.
 But 
the path itself and the psychic act which follows this path are 
two different matters.
 The act itself is slightly more complicated than we are prone to believe the imitation of the hysterical 
to be;
 it corresponds to an unconscious end-process, 
 as an example will show.
 The physician who has, 
 in the same ward with 
other patients, 
 a female patient suffering from a particular kind 
of twitching, 
 is not surprised if one morning he learns that this 
peculiar hysterical affection has found imitators.
 He merely tells 
himself: The others have seen her, 
 and have imitated her;
 this 
is psychic infection.
 — Yes, 
 but psychic infection occurs somewhat in the following manner: As a rule, 
 patients know more 
about one another than the physician knows about any one of 
them, 
 and they are concerned about one another when the doctor’s visit is over.
 One of them has an attack to-day: at once it 
is known to the rest that a letter from home, 
 a recrudescence of 
lovesickness, 
 or the like, 
 is the cause.
 Their sympathy is aroused, 
 
and although it does not emerge into consciousness they form the 
following conclusion: If it is possible to suffer such an attack 
from such a cause, 
 I too may suffer this sort of an attack, 
 for I 
have the same occasion for it.
 If this were a conclusion capable 
of becoming conscious, 
 it would perhaps express itself in dread.
 
of suffering a like attack;
 but it is formed in another psychic 
region, 
 and consequently ends in the realization of the dreaded 
symptoms.
 Thus identification is not mere imitation, 
 but an assimilation based upon the same etiological claim, 
 it expresses a 
just like, 
 and refers to some common condition which has remained in the unconscious.
 

In hysteria identification is most frequently employed to express a sexual community.
 The hysterical woman identifies herself by her symptoms most readily — though not exclusively — 
with persons with whom she had had sexual rdations, 
 or who 
have had sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself.
 
Language takes cognizance of this tendency: two lovers are said 
to be one.
 In hysterical phantasy, 
 as well as in dreams, 
 identification may ensue if one simply thinks of sexual relations;
 they 
need not necessarily become actual.
 The patient is merely following the rules of the hysterical processes of thought when die 
expresses her jealousy of her friend (which, 
 for that matter, 
 
she herself admits to be unjustified) by putting herself in her 
friend's place in her dream, 
 and identifying herself with her 
by fabricating a symptom (the denied wish).
 One might further 
elucidate the process by saying: In the dream she puts herself in 
the place of her friend, 
 because her friend has taken her own 
place in relation to her husband, 
 and because she would like to 
take her friend's place in her husband's esteem.
 7 

The contradiction of my theory of dreams on the part of another female patient, 
 the most intelligent of all my dreamers, 
 
was solved in a simpler fashion, 
 though still in accordance with 
the principle that the non-fulfilment of one wish signified the fulfilment of another.
 I had one day explained to her that a dream 
is a wish-fulfilment.
 On the following day she related a dream 
to the effect that she was travelling with her mother-in-law to 
the place in which they were both to spend the summer.
 Now I 
knew that she had violently protested against spending the summer in the neighbourhood of her mother-in-law.
 I also knew that 
she had fortunately been able to avoid doing so, 
 since she had 
recently succeeded in renting a house in a place quite remote 
from that to which her mother-in-law was going.
 And now the 
dream reversed this desired solution.
 Was not this a flat contradiction of my theory of wish-fulfilment? One had only to draw 
the inferences from this dream in order to arrive at its interpretation.
 According to this dream, 
 I was wrong;
 but it was her wish 
that I should be wrong , 
 and this wish the dream showed her as 
fulfilled .
 But the wish that I should be wrong, 
 which was fulfilled 
in the theme of the country house, 
 referred in reality to another 
and more serious matter.
 At that time I had inferred, 
 from the 
material furnished by her analysis, 
 that something of significance in respect to her illness must have occurred at a certain 
time in her life.
 She had denied this, 
 because it was not present 
in her memory.
 We soon came to see that I was right.
 Thus her 
wish that I should prove to be wrong, 
 which was transformed 
into the dream that she was going into the country with her 
mother-in-law, 
 corresponded with the justifiable wish that those 
things which were then only suspected had never occurred.
 

Without an analysis, 
 and merely by means of an assumption, 
 
I took the liberty of interpreting a little incident in the life of a 
friend, 
 who had been my companion through eight classes at 
school.
 He once heard a lecture of mine, 
 delivered to a small 
audience, 
 on the novel idea that dreams are wish-fulfilments.
 He 
went home, 
 dreamt that he had lost all Ms lawsuits — he was a 
lawyer — and then complained to me about it.
 I took refuge in 
the evasion: One can’t win all one’s cases;
 but I thought to 
myself: If, 
 for eight years, 
 I sat as primus on the first bench, 
 
while he moved up and down somewhere in the middle of the 
class, 
 may he not naturally have had the wish, 
 ever since his 
boyhood, 
 that I too might for once make a fool of myself? 

Yet another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me 
by a female patient in contradiction of my theory of the wishdream.
 This patient, 
 a young girl, 
 began as follows: You remember that my sister has now only one boy, 
 Charles.
 She lost 
the elder one, 
 Otto, 
 while I was still living with her.
 Otto was my 
favourite;
 it was I who really brought him up.
 I like the other 
little fellow, 
 too, 
 but, 
 of course, 
 not nearly so much as his dead 
brother.
 Now I dreamt last night that I saw Charles lying dead 
before me.
 He was lying in his little coffin, 
 his hands folded;
 
there were candles all about;
 and, 
 in short, 
 it was just as it was 
at the time of little Otto’s death, 
 which gave me such a shock.
 
Now tell me, 
 what does this mean? You know me — am I really 
so bad as to wish that my sister should lose the only child she 
has left? Or does the dream mean that I wish that Charles had 
died rather than Otto, 
 whom I liked so much better? 

I assured her that this latter interpretation was impossible.
 
After some reflection, 
 I was able to give her the interpretation 
of the dream, 
 which she subsequently confirmed.
 I was able to 
do so because the whole previous history of the dreamer was 
known to me.
 

Having become an orphan at an early age, 
 the girl had been 
brought up in the home of a much older sister, 
 and had met, 
 
among the friends and visitors who frequented the house, 
 a man 
who made a lasting impression upon her affections.
 It looked 
for a time as though these barely explicit relations would end in 
marriage, 
 but this happy culmination was frustrated by the 
sister, 
 whose motives were never completely explained.
 After 
the rupture the man whom my patient loved avoided the house;
 
she herself attained her independence some time after the death 
of little Otto, 
 to whom, 
 meanwhile, 
 her affections had turned.
 
But she did not succeed in freeing herself from the dependence 
due to her affection for her sister’s friend.
 Her pride bade her 
avoid him, 
 but she found it impossible to transfer her love to the 
other suitors who successively presented themselves.
 Whenever 
the man she loved, 
 who was a member of the literary profession, 
 
announced a lecture anywhere, 
 she was certain to be found 
among the audience;
 and she seized every other opportunity of 
seeing him unobserved.
 I remembered that on the previous day 
she had told me that the Professor was going to a certain concert, 
 and that she too was going, 
 in order to enjoy the sight of 
him.
 This was on the day before the dream;
 and the concert was 
to be given on the day on which she told me the dream.
 I could 
now easily see the correct interpretation, 
 and I asked her whether 
she could think of any particular event which had occurred 
after Otto’s death.
 She replied immediately: Of course;
 the 
Professor returned then, 
 after a long absence, 
 and I saw him once 
more beside little Otto’s coffin.
 It was just as I had expected.
 I 
interpreted the dream as follows: If now the other boy were 
to die, 
 the same thing would happen again.
 You would spend 
the day with your sister;
 the Professor would certainly come to 
offer his condolences, 
 and you would see him once more under 
the same circumstances as before.
 The dream signifies nothing 
more than this wish of yours to see him again — a wish against 
which you are fighting inwardly.
 I know that you have the ticket 
for to-day’s concert in your bag.
 Your dream is a dream of impatience;
 it has anticipated by several hours the meeting which 
is to take place to-day.
 

In order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in which wishes of the sort are commonly suppressed — a 
situation so sorrowful that love is not even thought of.
 And yet 
it is entirely possible that even in the actual situation beside the 
coffin of the elder, 
 more dearly loved boy, 
 she had not been able 
to suppress her tender affection for the visitor whom she had 
missed for so long.
 

A different explanation was found in the case of a similar 
dream of another patient, 
 who in earlier life had been distinguished for her quick wit and her cheerful disposition, 
 and who 
still displayed these qualities, 
 at all events in the free associations which occurred to her during treatment.
 In the course of 
a longer dream, 
 it seemed to this lady that she saw her fifteenyear-old daughter lying dead before her in a box.
 She was 
strongly inclined to use this dream-image as an objection to the 
theory of wish-fulfilment, 
 although she herself suspected that 
the detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the 
dream.
 8 For in the course of the analysis it occurred to her that 
on the previous evening the conversation of the people in whose 
company she found herself had turned on the English word 
box, 
 and upon the numerous translations of it into German 
such as Schachtel (box), 
 Logo (box at the theatre), 
 Kasten 
(chest), 
 Ohrjcige (box on the ear), 
 etc.
 From other components 
of the same dream it was now possible to add the fact that the 
lady had guessed at the relationship between the English word 
box and the German Buchsc, 
 and had then been haunted by 
the recollection that Biischse is used in vulgar parlance to denote the female genitals.
 It was therefore possible, 
 treating her 
knowledge of topographical anatomy with a certain indulgence, 
 
to assume that the child in the box signified a child in the mother’s womb.
 At this stage of the explanation she no longer denied 
that the picture in the dream actually corresponded with a wish 
of hers.
 Like so many other young women, 
 she was by no means 
happy on finding that she was pregnant, 
 and she had confessed 
to me more than once the wish that her child might die before 
its birth;
 in a fit of anger, 
 following a violent scene with her husband, 
 she had even struck her abdomen with her fists, 
 in order 
to injure the child within.
 The dead child was, 
 therefore, 
 really 
the fulfilment of a wish, 
 but a wish which had been put aside for 
fifteen years, 
 and it is not surprising that the fulfilment of the 
wish was no longer recognized after so long an interval.
 For 
there had been many changes in the meantime.
 

The group of dreams (having as content the death of beloved 
relatives) to which belong the last two mentioned will be considered again under the head of Typical Dreams.
 I shall then 
be able to show by new examples that in spite of their undesirable 
content all these dreams must be interpreted as wish-fulfilments.
 
For the following dream, 
 which again was told me in order to 
deter me from a hasty generalization of my theory, 
 I am indebted, 
 not to a patient, 
 but to an intelligent jurist of my acquaintance.
 1 dream, 
 my informant tells me, 
 that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my arm .
 Here a closed 
carriage is waiting;
 a man steps up to me, 
 shows me his authorization as a police officer, 
 and requests me to follow him.
 I ask 
only for time in which to arrange my affairs The jurist then 
asks me: Can you possibly suppose that it is my wish to be 
arrested? — Of course not, 
 I have to admit.
 Do you happen 
to know upon what charge you were arrested? — Yes;
 I believe for infanticide, 
 — Infanticide? But you know that only 
a mother can commit this crime upon her new-born child? — 
That is true.
 9 — And under what circumstances did you dream 
this? What happened on the evening before? — I would rather 
not tell you — it is a delicate matter.
 — But I need it, 
 otherwise 
we must forgo the interpretation of the dream.
 — Well, 
 then, 
 I 
will tell you.
 I spent the night, 
 not at home, 
 but in the house of 
a lady who means a great deal to me.
 When we awoke in the 
morning, 
 something again passed between us.
 Then I went to 
sleep again, 
 and dreamt what I have told you.
 — The woman 
is married? — Yes.
 — And you do not wish her to conceive? 
— No;
 that might betray us.
 — Then you do not practice 
normal coitus? — I take the precaution to withdraw before 
ejaculation.
 — Am I to* assume that you took this precaution 
several times during the night, 
 and that in the morning you were 
situation so sorrowful that love is not even thought of.
 And yet 
it is entirely possible that even in the actual situation beside the 
coffin of the elder, 
 more dearly loved boy, 
 she had not been able 
to suppress her tender affection for the visitor whom she had 
missed for so long.

several times during the night, 
 and that in the morning you were 
not quite sure whether you had succeeded? — That might be 
so.
 — Then your dream is the fulfilment of a wish.
 By the 
dream you are assured that you have not begotten a child, 
 or, 
 
what amounts to the same thing, 
 that you have killed the child.
 
I can easily demonstrate the connecting-links.
 Do you remember, 
 
a few days ago we were talking about the troubles of matrimony, 
 
and about the inconsistency of permitting coitus so long as no 
impregnation takes place, 
 while at the same time any preventive 
act committed after the ovum and the semen meet and a foetus 
is formed is punished as a crime? In this connection we recalled 
the medieval controversy about the moment of time at which 
the soul actually enters into the foetus, 
 since the concept of 
murder becomes admissible only from that point onwards.
 Of 
course, 
 too, 
 you know the gruesome poem by Lenau, 
 which puts 
infanticide and birth-control on the same plane.
 — Strangely 
enough, 
 I happened, 
 as though by chance, 
 to think of Lenau this 
morning.
 — '‘Another echo of your dream.
 And now I shall show 
you yet another incidental wish-fulfilment in your dream.
 You 
walk up to your house with the lady on your arm.
 So you take her 
home, 
 instead of spending the night at her house, 
 as you did in 
reality.
 The fact that the wish-fulfilment, 
 which is the essence of 
the dream, 
 disguises itself hi such an unpleasant form, 
 has perhaps more than one explanation.
 From my essay on the etiology 
of anxiety neurosis, 
 you will see that I note coitus interrupts as 
one of the factors responsible for the development of neurotic fear.
 
It would be consistent with this if, 
 after repeated coitus of this 
kind, 
 you were left in an uncomfortable frame of mind, 
 which now 
becomes an element of the composition of your dream.
 You even 
make use of this uncomfortable state of mind to conceal the 
wish-fulfilment.
 At the same time, 
 the mention of infanticide has 
not yet been explained.
 Why does this crime, 
 which is peculiar 
to females, 
 occur to you? — I will confess to you that I was 
involved in such an affair years ago.
 I was responsible for the 
fact that a girl tried to protect herself from the consequences of a 
liaison with me by procuring an abortion.
 I had nothing to do 
with the carrying out of her plan, 
 but for a long time I was naturally worried in case the affair might be discovered.
 — I understand.
 This recollection furnished a second reason why the supposition
that you had performed coitus interruptus cl ums ily 
must have been painful to you.
 

A young physician, 
 who heard this dream related in my lecture-room, 
 must have felt that it fitted him, 
 for he hastened to 
imitate it by a dream of his own, 
 applying its mode of thinking 
to another theme.
 On the previous day he had furnished a statement of his income;
 a quite straightforward statement, 
 because 
he had little to state.
 He dreamt that an acquaintance of his 
came from a meeting of the tax commission and informed him 
that all the other statements had passed unquestioned, 
 but that 
his own had aroused general suspicion, 
 with the result that he 
would be punished with a heavy fine.
 This dream is a poorly disguised fulfilment of the wish to be known as a physician with a 
large income.
 It also calls to mind the story of the young girl who 
was advised against accepting her suitor because he was a man 
of quick temper, 
 who would assuredly beat her after their marriage.
 Her answer was: I wish he would strike me I Her wish 
to be married was so intense that she had taken into consideration 
the discomforts predicted for this marriage;
 she had even raised 
them to the plane of a wish.
 

If I group together the very frequent dreams of this sort, 
 which 
seem flatly to contradict my theory, 
 in that they embody the 
denial of a wish or some occurrence obviously undesired, 
 under 
the head of counter-wish-dreams, 
 I find that they may all be 
referred to two principles, 
 one of which has not yet been mentioned, 
 though it plays a large part in waking as well as dreamlife.
 One of the motives inspiring these dreams is the wish that I 
should appear in the wrong.
 These dreams occur regularly in the 
course of treatment whenever the patient is in a state of resistance;
 indeed, 
 I can with a great deal of certainty count on evoking such a dream once I have explained to the patient my theory 
that the dream is a wish-fulfilment .
 10 Indeed, 
 I have reason to 
expect that many of my readers will have such dreams, 
 merely 
to fulfil the wish that I may prove to be wrong.
 The last dream 
which I shall recount from among those occurring in the course 
of treatment once more demonstrates this very thing.
 A young 
girl who had struggled hard to continue my treatment, 
 against 
the will of her relatives and the authorities whom they had consulted, 
 dreamt the following dream: At home she is forbidden 
to come to me any more.
 She then reminds me of the promise I 
made to treat her for nothing if necessary, 
 and I tell her:  I can 
show no consideration in money matters.
 

It is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfilment 
of a wish, 
 but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, 
 
the solution of which helps also to solve the first.
 Where does 
she get the words which she puts into my mouth? Of course, 
 I 
have never told her anything of the kind ;
 but one of her brothers, 
 
the one who has the greatest influence over her, 
 has been kind 
enough to make this remark about me.
 It is then the purpose of 
the dream to show that her brother is right;
 and she does not 
try to justify this brother merely in the dream;
 it is her purpose 
in life and the motive of her illness.
 

A dream which at first sight presents peculiar difficulties for 
the theory of wish-fulfilment was dreamed by a physician (Aug.
 
Starcke) and interpreted by him: I have and see on the last 
phalange of my left forefinger a primary syphilitic affection.
" 

One may perhaps be inclined to refrain from analysing this 
dream, 
 since it seems clear and coherent, 
 except for its unwishedfor content.
 However, 
 if one takes the trouble to make an analysis, 
 one learns that primary affection reduces itself to prima 
affectio (first love), 
 and that the repulsive sore, 
 in the words of 
Starke, 
 proves to be the representative of wish-fulfilments 
charged with intense emotion .
 
yet these are for them nothing more than -wish-fulfilments, 
 which 
satisfy their masochistic inclinations.
 Here is such a dream: A 
young man, 
 who in earlier youth greatly tormented his elder 
brother, 
 toward whom he was homosexually inclined, 
 but who 
has since undergone a complete change of character, 
 has the 
following dream, 
 which consists of three parts: (1) He is 
 teased  by his brother.
 (2) Two adults are caressing each other 
with homosexual intentions.
 (3) His brother has sold the business, 
 the management of which the young man had reserved for 
his own future.
 From this last dream he awakens with the most 
unpleasant feelings;
 and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, 
 
which might be translated: It would serve me right if my brother 
were to make that sale against my interests.
 It would be my 
punishment for all the torments he has suffered at my hands.
 

I hope that the examples given above will suffice — until some 
further objection appears — to make it seem credible that even 
dreams with a painful content are to be analysed as wish-fulfilments.
 12 Nor should it be considered a mere matter of chance 
that in the course of interpretation one always happens upon 
subjects about which one does not like to speak or think.
 The 
disagreeable sensation which such dreams arouse is of course 
precisely identical with the antipathy which would, 
 and usually 
does, 
 restrain us from treating or discussing such subjects — an 
antipathy which must be overcome by all of us if we find ourselves obliged to attack the problem of such dreams.
 But this 
disagreeable feeling which recurs in our dreams does not preclude the existence of a wish;
 everyone has wishes which he 
would not like to confess to others, 
 which he does not care to admit even to himself.
 On the other hand, 
 we feel justified in connecting the unpleasant character of all these dreams with the 
fact of dream-distortion, 
 and in concluding that these dreams are 
distorted, 
 and that their wish-fulfilment is disguised beyond 
recognition, 
 precisely because there is a strong revulsion against 
— a will to repress — the subject-matter of the dream, 
 or the 
wish created by it.
 Dream-distortion, 
 then, 
 proves in reality to 
be an act of the censorship.
 We shall have included everything 
which the analysis of disagreeable dreams has brought to light 
if we reword our formula thus: The dream is the (disguised) 
fulfilment of a ( suppressed , 
 repressed) wish .
 13 

Now there still remain to be considered, 
 as a particular suborder of dreams with painful content, 
 the anxiety-dreams, 
 the 
inclusion of which among the wish-dreams will be still less acceptable to the uninitiated.
 But I can here deal very cursorily 
with the problem of anxiety-dreams;
 what they have to reveal 
is not a new aspect of the dream-problem;
 here the problem is 
that of understanding neurotic anxiety in general.
 The anxiety 
which we experience in dreams is only apparently explained by 
the dream-content.
 If we subject that content to analysis, 
 we 
become aware that the dream-anxiety is no more justified by 
the dream-content than the anxiety in a phobia is justified by the 
idea to which the phobia is attached.
 For example, 
 it is true 
that it is possible to fall out of a window, 
 and that a certain care 
shoud be exercised when one is at a window, 
 but it is not obvious why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so great, 
 
and why it torments its victims more than its cause would warrant.
 The same explanation which applies to the phobia applies 
also to the anxiety-dream.
 In either case the anxiety is only 
fastened on to the idea which accompanies it, 
 and is really derived from another source.
 

On account of this intimate relation of dream-anxiety to neurotic anxiety, 
 the discussion of the former obliges me to refer to 
the latter.
 In a little essay on Anxiety Neurosis , 
 14 written in 1895, 
 
I maintain that neurotic anxiety has its origin in the sexual life, 
 
and corresponds to a libido which has been deflected from its 
object and has found no employment.
 The accuracy of this formula has since then been demonstrated with ever-increasing 
certainty.
 From it we may deduce the doctrine that anxietydreams are dreams of sexual content, 
 and that the libido appertaining to this content has been transformed into anxiety.
 Later 
on I shall have an opportunity of confirming this assertion by 
the analysis of several dreams of neurotics.
 In my further attempts to arrive at a theory of dreams I shall again have occasion 
to revert to the conditions of anxiety-dreams and their compatibility with the theory of wish-fulfilment.
 

Having realized, 
 as a result of analysing the dream of Irma’s 
injection, 
 that the dream was the fulfilment of a wish, 
 we were 
immediately interested to ascertain whether we had thereby discovered a general characteristic of dreams, 
 and for the time 
being we put aside every other scientific problem which may 
have suggested itself in the course of the interpretation.
 Now 
that we have reached the goal on this one path, 
 we may turn 
back and select a new point of departure for exploring dreamproblems, 
 even though we may for a time lose sight of the theme 
of wish-fulfilment, 
 which has still to be further considered.
 

Now that we are able, 
 by applying our process of interpretation, 
 to detect a latent dream-content whose significance far surpasses that of the manifest dream-content, 
 we are naturally impelled to return to the individual dream-problems, 
 in order to 
see whether the riddles and contradictions which seemed to elude 
us when we had only the manifest content to work upon may 
not now be satisfactorily solved.
 

The opinions of previous writers on the relation of dreams to 
waking life, 
 and the origin of the material of dreams, 
 have not 
been given here.
 We may recall however three peculiarities of 
the memory in dreams, 
 which have often been noted, 
 but never 
explained: — 

i.
 That the dream clearly prefers the impressions of the last 
few days (Robert, 
 Striimpell, 
 Hildebrandt;
 also WeedHallam) ;
 

2.
 That it makes a selection in accordance with principles 
other than those governing onr waking memory, 
 in that it 
recalls not essential and important, 
 but subordinate and 
disregarded things;
 

3.
 That it has at its disposal the earliest impressions of our 
childhood, 
 and brings to light details from this period of 
life, 
 which, 
 again, 
 seem trivial to us, 
 and which in waking 
life were believed to have been long since forgotten.
 1 

These peculiarities in the dream’s choice of material have, 
 of 
course, 
 been observed by previous writers in the manifest dreamcontent* 


A.
 RECENT AND INDIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS 
IN THE DREAM 

If I now consult my own experience with regard to the origin of 
the elements appearing in the dream-content, 
 I must in the 
first place express the opinion that in every dream we may find 
some reference to the experiences of the preceding day .
 Whatever dream I turn to, 
 whether my own or someone else’s, 
 this 
experience is always confirmed.
 Knowing this, 
 I may perhaps 
begin the work of interpretation by looking for the experience of 
the preceding day which has stimulated the dream;
 in many 
cases this is indeed the quickest way.
 With the two dreams which 
I subjected to a close analysis in the last chapter (the dreams of 
Irma’s injection, 
 and of the uncle with the yellow beard) the 
reference to the preceding day is so evident that it needs no further elucidation.
 But in order to show how constantly this reference may be demonstrated, 
 I shall examine a portion of my 
own dream-chronicle.
 I shall relate only so much of the dreams 
as is necessary for the detection of the dream-source in question.
 

1.
 I pay a call at a house to which I gain admittance only with 
difficulty , 
 etc.
, 
 and meanwhile I am keeping a woman waiting 
for me .
 

1 It is evident that Roberts idea — that the dream is intended to rid our 
memory of the useless impressions which it has received during the day — 
is no longer tenable if indifferent memories of our childhood appear in our 
dreams with some degree of frequency.
 We should be obliged to conclude 
that our dreams generally perform their prescribed task very inadequately.

 etc.
 

The question might be raised, 
 whether a dream invariably 
refers to the events of the preceding day only, 
 or whether the 
reference may be extended to include impressions from a longer 
period of time in the immediate past.
 This question is probably 
not of the first importance, 
 but I am inclined to decide in favour 
of the exclusive priority of the day before the dream (the dreamday) .
 Whenever I thought I had found a case where an impression two or three days old was the source of the dream, 
 I was 
able to convince myself after careful investigation that this impression
had been remembered the day before;
 that is, 
 that a 
demonstrable reproduction on the day before had been interpolated between the day of the event and the time of the dream;
 
and further, 
 I was able to point to the recent occasion which 
might have given rise to the recollection of the older impression.
 
On the other hand, 
 I was unable to convince myself that a regular interval of biological significance (H.
 Swoboda gives the first 
interval of this kind as eighteen hours) elapses between the 
dream-exciting daytime impression and its recurrence in the 
dream.
 

I believe, 
 therefore, 
 that for every dream a dream-stimulus 
may be found among those experiences on which one has not yet 
slept.
 

Havelock Ellis, 
 who has likewise given attention to this problem, 
 states that he has not been able to find any such periodicity 
of reproduction in his dreams, 
 although he has looked for it.
 He 
relates a dream in which he found himself in Spain;
 he wanted 
to travel to a place called Daraus , 
 Varans, 
 or Zaraus .
 On awaking he was unable to recall any such place-names, 
 and thought no 
more of the matter.
 A few months later he actually found the 
name Zaraus;
 it was that of a railway-station between San Sebastian and Bilbao, 
 through which he had passed in the train 
eight months (250 days) before the date of the dream.
 

Thus the impressions of the immediate past (with the exception of the day before the night of the dream) stands in the same 
relation to the dream-content as those of periods indefinitely 
remote.
 The dream may select its material from any period of 
life, 
 provided only that a chain of thought leads back from the 
experiences of the day of the dream (the recent impressions) 
of that earlier period.
 

But why this preference for recent impressions? We shall arrive at some conjectures on this point if we subject one of the 
dreams already mentioned to a more precise analysis.
 I select the 

Dream of the Botanical Monograph 

I have written a monograph on a certain plant .
 The book lies 
before me;
 I am just turning over a folded coloured plate .
 A 
dried specimen of the plant, 
 as though from a herbarium, 
 is 
bound up with every copy.
 


Analysis: 

In the morning I saw in a bookseller’s window a volume entitled 
The Gams Cyclamen, 
 apparently a monograph on this plant.
 

The cyclamen is my wife’s favourite flower.
 I reproach myself 
for remembering so seldom to bring her flowers, 
 as she would 
like me to do.
 In connection with the theme of giving her flowers, 
 
I am reminded of a story which I recently told some friends of 
mine in proof of my assertion that we often forget in obedience 
to a purpose of the unconscious, 
 and that forgetfulness always 
enables us to form a deduction about the secret disposition of 
the forgetful person.
 A young woman who has been accustomed 
to receive a bouquet of flowers from her husband on her birthday 
misses this token of affection on one of her birthdays, 
 and bursts 
into tears.
 The husband comes in, 
 and cannot understand why 
she is crying until she tells him: To-day is my birthday.
 He 
claps his hand to bis forehead, 
 and exclaims: Oh, 
 forgive me, 
 
I had completely forgotten it! and proposes to go out immediately in order to get her flowers.
 But she refuses to be consoled, 
 for she sees in her husband’s forgetfulness a proof that 
she no longer plays the same part in his thoughts as she formerly 
did.
 This Frau L.
 met my wife two days ago, 
 told her that she 
was feeling well, 
 and asked after me.
 Some years ago she was a 
patient of mine.
 

Supplementary facts: I did once actually write something 
like a monograph on a plant, 
 namely, 
 an essay on the coca plant, 
 
which attracted the attention of K.
 Roller to the anaesthetic 
properties of cocaine.
 I had hinted that the alkaloid might be 
employed as an anaesthetic, 
 but I was not thorough enough to 
pursue the matter farther.
 It occurs to me, 
 too, 
 that on the 
morning of the day following the dream (for the interpretation 
of which I did not find time until the evening) I had thought of 
cocaine in a kind of day-dream.
 If I were ever afflicted with 
glaucoma, 
 I would go to Berlin, 
 and there undergo an operation, 
 
Incognito, 
 in the house of my Berlin friend, 
 at the hands of a 
surgeon whom he would recommend.
 The surgeon, 
 who would 
not know the name of his patient, 
 would boast, 
 as usual, 
 how 
easy these operations had become since the introduction of 
cocaine;
 and I should not betray the fact that I myself had a 
share in this discovery.
 With this phantasy were connected 
thoughts of how awkward it really is for a physician to claim the 
professional services of a colleague.
 I should be able to pay the 
Berlin eye specialist, 
 who did not know me, 
 like anyone else.
 
Only after recalling this day-dream do I realize that there is 
concealed behind it the memory of a definite event.
 Shortly after 
Roller’s discovery, 
 my father contracted glaucoma;
 he was operated on by my friend Dr.
 Koenigstein, 
 the eye special.
 Dr.
 
Roller was in charge of the cocaine anaesthetization, 
 and he 
made the remark that on this occasion all the three persons who 
had been responsible for the introduction of cocaine had been 
brought together.
 

My thoughts now pass on to the time when I was last reminded of the history of cocaine.
 This was a few days earlier, 
 
when I received a Festschrift , 
 a publication in which grateful 
pupils had commemorated the jubilee of their teacher and laboratory director.
 Among the titles to fame of persons connected 
with the laboratory I found a note to the effect that the discovery 
of the anaesthetic properties of cocaine had been due to R.
 
Roller.
' Now I suddenly become aware that the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening.
 I had just 
accompanied Dr.
 Roenigstein to his home, 
 and had entered into 
a discussion of a subject which excites me greatly whenever it is 
mentioned.
 While I was talking with him in the entrance-hall 
Professor Gartner and his young wife came up.
 I could not refrain 
from congratulating them both upon their blooming appearance.
 
Now Professor Gartner is one of the authors of the Festschrift of 
which I have just spoken, 
 and he may well have reminded me 
of it.
 And Frau L.
, 
 of whose birthday disappointment I spoke 
a little way back, 
 had been mentioned, 
 though of course in another connection, 
 in my conversation with Dr.
 Roenigstein.
 

I shall now try to elucidate the other determinants of the 
dream-content.
 A dried specimen of the plant accompanies the 
monograph, 
 as though it were a herbarium .
 And herbarium reminds me of the gymnasium.
 The director of our gymnasium 
once called the pupils of the upper classes together, 
 in order that 
they might examine and clean the gymnasium herbarium.
 
Small insects had been found — book-worms.
 The director seemed 
to have little confidence in my ability to assist, 
 for he entrusted 
me with only a few of the pages.
 Iknow to this day that there were 
crucifers on them.
 My interest in botany was never very great.
 
At my preliminary examination in botany I was required to 
identify a crucifer, 
 and failed to recognize it;
 had not my 
theoretical knowledge come to my aid, 
 I should have fared badly 
indeed.
 Crucifers suggest composites.
 The artichoke is really a 
composite, 
 and in actual fact one which I might call my favourite 
flower.
 My wife, 
 more thoughtful than I, 
 often brings this 
favourite flower of mine home from the market.
 

I see the monograph which I have written lying before me.
 
Here again there is an association.
 My friend wrote to me yesterday from Berlin: I am thinking a great deal about your 
dream-book.
 I see it lying before me, 
 completed, 
 and I turn the 
pages.
 How I envied him this power of vision! If only I could 
see it lying before me, 
 already completed! 

The folded coloured plate.
 When I was a medical student I 
suffered a sort of craze for studying monographs exclusively.
 In 
spite of my limited means, 
 I subscribed to a number of the 
medical periodicals, 
 whose coloured plates afforded me much 
delight.
 I was rather proud of this inclination to thoroughness.
 
When I subsequently began to publish books myself, 
 I had to 
draw the plates for my own treatises, 
 and I remember one of 
them turned out so badly that a well-meaning colleague ridiculed me for it.
 With this is associated, 
 I do not exactly know 
how, 
 a very early memory of my childhood.
 My father, 
 by way 
of a jest, 
 once gave my elder sister and myself a book containing 
coloured plates (the book was a narrative of a journey through 
Persia) in order that we might destroy it.
 From an educational 
point of view this was hardly to be commended.
 I was at the 
time five years old, 
 and my sister less than three, 
 and the picture 
of us two children blissfully tearing the book to pieces (I should 
add, 
 like an artichoke, 
 leaf by leaf), 
 is almost the only one from 
this period of my life which has remained vivid in my memory.
 
When I afterwards became a student, 
 I developed a conspicuous 
fondness for collecting and possessing books (an analogy to the 
inclination for studying from monographs, 
 a hobby alluded to 
in my dream-thoughts, 
 in connection with cyclamen and artichoke).
 I became a book-worm (cf.
 herbarium ) .
 Ever since I 
have been engaged in introspection I have always traced this 
earliest passion of my life to this impression of my childhood: 
or rather, 
 I have recognized in this childish scene a screen or 
concealing memory for my subsequent bibliophilia.
 2 And of 
course I learned at an early age that our passions often become 
our misfortunes.
 When I was seventeen, 
 I ran up a very considerable account at the bookseller’s, 
 with no means with which 
to settle it, 
 and my father would hardly accept it as an excuse 
that my passion was at least a respectable one.
 But the mention 
of this experience of my youth brings me back to my conversation with my friend Dr.
 Koenigstein on the evening preceding 
the dream;
 for one of the themes of this conversation was the 
same old reproach — that I am much too absorbed in my hobbies .
 

For reasons which are not relevant here I shall not continue 
the interpretation of this dream, 
 but will merely indicate the 
path which leads to it.
 In the course of the interpretation I was 
reminded of my conversation with Dr.
 Koenigstein, 
 and, 
 indeed, 
 
of more than one portion of it.
 When I consider the subjects 
touched upon in this conversation, 
 the meaning of the dream 
immediately becomes clear to me.
 All the trains of thought 
which have been started — my own inclinations, 
 and those of my 
wife, 
 the cocaine, 
 the awkwardness of securing medical treatment from one’s own colleagues, 
 my preference for monographical studies, 
 and my neglect of certain subjects, 
 such as botany — 
all these are continued in and lead up to one branch or another 
of this widely-ramified conversation.
 The dream once more assumes the character of a justification, 
 of a plea for my rights 
(like the dream of Irma’s injection, 
 the first to be analysed) ;
 it 
even continues the theme which that dream introduced, 
 and discusses it in association with the new subject-matter which has 
been added in the interval between the two dreams.
 Even the 
dream’s apparently indifferent form of expression at once acquires a meaning.
 Now it means: I am indeed the man who has 
2 Cf.
 The Psychopathology of Everyday Life .
 

written, 
 that valuable and successful treatise (on cocaine), 
 just 
as previously I declared in self-justification: I am after dl a 
thorough and industrious student;
 and in both instances I find 
the meaning: I can allow myself this.
 But I may dispense with 
the further interpretation of the dream, 
 because my only purpose 
in recording it was to examine the relation of the dream-content 
to the experience of the previous day which arouses it.
 As long 
as I know only the manifest content of this dream, 
 only one 
relation to any impression of the day is obvious;
 but after I 
have completed the interpretation, 
 a second source of the dream 
becomes apparent in another experience of the same day.
 The 
first of these impressions to which the dream refers is an indifferent one, 
 a subordinate circumstance.
 I see a book in a shop 
window whose title holds me for a moment, 
 but whose contents 
would hardly interest me.
 The second experience was of great 
psychic value;
 I talked earnestly with my friend, 
 the eye specialist, 
 for about an hour;
 I made allusions in this conversation 
which must have ruffled the feelings of both of us, 
 and which in 
me awakened memories in connection with which I was aware 
of a great variety of inner stimuli.
 Further, 
 this conversation was 
broken off unfinished, 
 because some acquaintances joined us.
 
What, 
 now, 
 is the relation of these two impressions of the day 
to one another, 
 and to the dream which followed during the 
night? 

In the manifest dream-content I find merely an illusion to the 
indifferent impression, 
 and I am thus able to reaffirm that the 
dream prefers to take up into its content experiences of a nonessential character.
 In the dream-interpretation, 
 on the contrary, 
 
everything converges upon the important and justifiably disturbing event.
 If I judge the sense of the dream in the only cor- , 
 
rect way, 
 according to the latent content which is brought to 
light in the analysis, 
 I find that I have unwittingly lighted upon 
a new and important discovery.
 I see that the puzzling theory 
that the dream deals only with the worthless odds and ends of 
the day’s experiences has no justification;
 I am also compelled to 
contradict the assertion that the psychic life of the waking state 
is not continued in the dream, 
 and that hence, 
 the dream wastes 
our psychic energy on trivial material.
 The very opposite is true;
 
what has claimed our attention during the day do min ates our 
dream-thoughts also, 
 and we take pains to dream only in connection with such matters as have given us food for thought 
during the day.
 

Perhaps the most immediate explanation of the fact tb^t I 
dream of the indifferent impression of the day, 
 while the iripression which has with good reason excited me causes me to dream, 
 
is that here again we are dealing with the phenomenon of dreamdistortion, 
 which we have referred to as a psychic force playing 
the part of a censorship.
 The recollection of the monograph on 
the genus cyclamen is utilized as though it were an.
 allusion to 
the conversation with my friend, 
 just as the mention of my patient’s friend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented 
by the allusion smoked salmon.
 The only question is, 
 by what 
intermediate links can the impression of the monograph come 
to assume the relation of allusion to the conversation with the 
eye specialist, 
 since such a relation is not at first perceptible? In 
the example of the deferred supper the relation is evident at the 
outset;
 smoked salmon, 
 as the favourite dish of the patient’s 
friend, 
 belongs to the circle of ideas which the friend’s personality would naturally evoke in the mind of the dreamer.
 In our 
new example we are dealing with two entirely separate impressions, 
 which at first glance seem to have nothing in common, 
 
except indeed that they occur on the same day.
 The monograph 
attracts my attention in the morning: in the evening I take part 
in the conversation.
 The answer furnished by the analysis is as 
follows: Such relations between the two impressions as do not 
exist from the first are established subsequently between the 
idea-content of the one impression and the idea-content of the 
other.
 I have already picked out the intermediate links emphasized in the course of writing the analysis.
 Only under some 
outside influence, 
 perhaps the recollection of the flowers missed 
by Frau L.
, 
 would the idea of the monograph on the cyclamen 
have attached itself to the idea that the cyclamen is my wife’s 
favourite flower.
 I do not believe that these inconspicuous 
thoughts would have sufficed to evoke a dream.
 

There needs no ghost , 
 my lord , 
 come from the grave 
To tell us this/ 9 


So 

as we read in Hamlet.
 But behold 1 in the analysis I am reminded 
that the name of the man who interrupted our conversation was 
Gartner (gardener), 
 and that I thought his wife looked blooming;
 indeed, 
 now I even remember that one of my female patients, 
 who bears the pretty name of Flora, 
 was for a time the 
main subject of our conversation.
 It must have happened that 
by means of these intermediate links from the sphere of botanical 
ideas the association was effected between the two events of 
the day, 
 the indifferent one and the stimulating one.
 Other relations were then established, 
 that of cocaine for example, 
 which 
can with perfect appropriateness form a link between the person 
of Dr.
 Koenigstein and the botanical monograph which I have 
written, 
 and thus secure the fusion of the two circles of ideas, 
 
so that now a portion of the first experience may be used as an 
allusion to the second.
 

I am prepared to find this explanation attacked as either 
arbitrary or artificial.
 What would have happened if Professor 
Gartner and his blooming wife had not appeared, 
 and if the 
patient who was under discussion had been called, 
 not Flora, 
 
but Anna? And yet the answer is not hard to find.
 If these 
thought-relations had not been available, 
 others would probably 
have been selected.
 It is easy to establish relations of this sort, 
 
as the jocular questions and conundrums with which we amuse 
ourselves suffice to show.
 The range of wit is unlimited.
 To go a 
step farther: if no sufficiently fertile associations between the 
two impressions of the day could have been established, 
 the 
dream would simply have followed a different course;
 another 
of the indifferent impressions of the day, 
 such as come to us in 
multitudes and are forgotten, 
 would have taken the place of 
the monograph in the dream, 
 would have formed an association 
with the content of the conversation, 
 and would have represented 
this in the dream.
 Since it was the impression of the monograph 
and no other that was fated to perform this function, 
 this impression was probably that most suitable for the purpose.
 One 
need not, 
 like Lessing’s Hdnschen Schlau, 
 be astonished tha t 
only the rich people of the world possess the most money.
 

Still, 
 the psychological process by which, 
 according to our 
exposition, 
 the indifferent experience substitutes itself for the 
psychologically important one seems to us odd and open to 
question.
 In a later chapter we shall undertake the task of making the peculiarities of this seemingly incorrect operation more 
intelligible.
 Here we are concerned only with the result of this 
process, 
 which we were compelled to accept by constantly recurring experiences in the analysis of dreams.
 In this process it 
is as though, 
 in the course of the intermediate steps, 
 a displacement occurs — let us say, 
 of the psychic accent — until ideas of 
feeble potential, 
 by taking over the charge from ideas which 
have a stronger initial potential, 
 reach a degree of intensity 
which enables them to force their way into consciousness.
 Such 
displacements do not in the least surprise us when it is a question 
of the transference of affective magnitudes or of motor activities.
 
That the lonely spinster transfers her affection to animals, 
 that 
the bachelor becomes a passionate collector, 
 that the soldier 
defends a scrap of coloured cloth — his flag — with his life-blood, 
 
that in a love-affair a clasp of the hands a moment longer than 
usual evokes a sensation of bliss, 
 or that in Othello a lost handkerchief causes an outburst of rage — all these are examples of 
psychic displacements which to us seem incontestable.
 But if, 
 
by the same means, 
 and in accordance with the same fundamental principles, 
 a decision is made as to what is to reach our 
consciousness and what is to be withheld from it — that is to 
say, 
 what we are to think — this gives us the impression of morbidity, 
 and if it occurs in waking life we call it an error of 
thought.
 We may here anticipate the result of a discussion which 
will be undertaken later, 
 namely, 
 that the psychic process which 
we have recognized in dream-displacement proves to be not a 
morbidly deranged process, 
 but one merely differing from the 
normal, 
 one of a more primary nature.
 

Thus we interpret the fact that the dream-content takes up 
r emnan ts of trivial experiences as a manifestation of dream-distortion (by displacement), 
 and we thereupon remember that we 
have recognized this dream-distortion as the work of a censorship 
operating between the two psychic instances.
 We may therefore 
expect tha t dream-analysis will constantly show us the real and 
psychically sig n ifi c ant source of the dream in the events of the 
day, 
 the memory of which has transferred its accentuation to 
some indifferent memory.
 This conception is in complete opposition to Robert's theory, 
 which consequently has no further 
value for us.
 The fact which Robert was trying to explain 
simply does not exist;
 its assumption is based on a misunderstanding, 
 on a failure to substitute the real meaning of the dream 
for its apparent meaning.
 A further objection to Robert’s doctrine is as follows: If the task of the dream were really to rid 
our memory, 
 by means of a special psychic activity, 
 of the 
slag of the day's recollections, 
 our sleep would perforce be 
more troubled, 
 engaged in more strenuous work, 
 than we can 
suppose it to be, 
 judging by our waking thoughts.
 For the number of the indifferent impressions of the day against which we 
should have to protect our memory is obviously immeasurably 
large;
 the whole night would not be long enough to dispose of 
them all.
 It is far more probable that the forgetting of the indifferent impressions takes place without any active interference 
on the part of our psychic powers.
 

Still, 
 something cautions us against taking leave of Robert's 
theory without further consideration.
 We have left unexplained 
the fact that one of the indifferent impressions of the day — indeed, 
 even of the previous day — constantly makes a contribution 
to the dream-content.
 The relations between this impression and 
the real source of the dream in the unconscious do not always 
exist from the outset;
 as we have seen, 
 they are established 
subsequently, 
 while the dream is actually at work, 
 as though to 
serve the purpose of the intended displacement.
 Something, 
 
therefore, 
 must necessitate the opening up of connections in the 
direction of the recent but indifferent impression;
 this impression must possess some quality that gives it a special fitness.
 
Otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream-thoughts to 
shift their accentuation to some inessential component of their 
own sphere of ideas.
 

Experiences such as the following show us the way to an 
explanation: If the day has brought us two or more experiences 
which are worthy to evoke a dream, 
 the dream will blend the 
allusion of both into a single whole: it obeys a compulsion to 
make them into a single whole .
 For example: One summer afternoon I entered a railway carriage in which I found two acquaintances of mine who were unknown to one another.
 One of them 
was an influential colleague, 
 the other a member of a distinguished family which I had been attending in my professional 
capacity.
 I introduced the two gentlemen to each other;
 but 
during the long journey they conversed with each other through 
me, 
 so that I had to discuss this or that topic now with one, 
 now 
with the oilier.
 I asked my colleague to recommend a mutual 
acquaintance who had just begun to practice as a physician.
 He 
replied that he was convinced of the young man’s ability, 
 but 
that his undistinguished appearance would make it difficult for 
him to obtain patients in the upper ranks of society.
 To this I 
rejoined: That is precisely why he needs recommendation.
 A 
little later, 
 turning to my other fellow-traveller, 
 I inquired after 
the health of his aunt — the mother of one of my patients — who 
was at this time prostrated by a serious illness.
 On the night 
following this journey I dreamt that the young friend whom I 
had asked one of my companions to recommend was in a fashionable drawing-room, 
 and with all the bearing of a man of 
the world was making — before a distinguished company, 
 in 
which I recognized all the rich and aristocratic persons of my 
acquaintance — a funeral oration over the old lady (who in my 
dream had already died) who was the aunt of my second fellowtraveller.
 (I confess frankly that I had not been on good terms 
with this lady.
) Thus my dream had once more found the connection between the two impressions of the day, 
 and by means 
of the two had constructed a unified situation.
 

In view of many similar experiences I am persuaded to advance the proposition that a dream works under a kind of compulsion which forces it to combine into a unified whole all the 
sources of dream-stimulation which are offered to it.
 3 In a subsequent chapter (on the function of dreams) we shall consider 
this impulse of combination as part of the process of condensation, 
 another primary psychic process.
 

I shall now consider the question whether the dream-exciting 
source to which our analysis leads us must always be a recent 
(and significant) event, 
 or whether a subjective experience — 
that is to say, 
 the recollection of a psychologically significant 
event, 
 a train of thought — may assume the r61e of a dreamstimulus.
 The very definite answer, 
 derived from numerous analyses, 
 is as follows: The stimulus of the dream may be a subjective transaction, 
 which has been made recent, 
 as it were, 
 by 
the mental activity of the day.
 

And this is perhaps the best time to summarize in schematic 
form the different conditions under which the dream-sources 
are operative.
 

The source of a dream may be: — 

(a) A recent and psychologically significant event which is 
directly represented in the dream.
 4 

(5) Several recent and significant events, 
 which are combined by the dream into a single whole.
 5 

(c) One or more recent and significant events, 
 which are 
represented in the dream-content by allusion to a contemporary 
but indifferent event.
 6 

(d) A subjectively significant experience (recollection, 
 train 
of thought), 
 which is constantly represented in the dream by 
allusion to a recent but indifferent impression.
 7 

As may be seen, 
 in dream-interpretation the condition is always fulfilled that one component of the dream-content repeats 
a recent impression of the day of the dream.
 The component 
which is destined to be represented in the dream may either belong to the same circle of ideas as the dream-stimulus itself (as 
an essential or even an inessential element of the same) , 
 or it 
may originate in the neighbourhood of an indifferent impression, 
 
which has been brought by more or less abundant associations 
into relation with the sphere of the dream-stimulus.
 The apparent multiplicity of these conditions results merely from the 
alternative , 
 that a displacement has or has not occurred , 
 and it 
may here be noted that this alternative enables us to explain the 
contrasts of the dream quite as readily as the medical theory of 

4 The dream of Irina’s injection;
 the dream of the friend who is my unde.
 

6 The dream of the funeral oration delivered by the young physidan, 
 

6 The dream of the botanical monograph.
 

7 The dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind.
 


THE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS 85 

the dream explains the series of states from the partial to the 
complete waking of the brain cells.
 

In considering this series of sources we note further that the 
psychologically significant but not recent element (a train of 
thought, 
 a recollection) may be replaced for the purposes of 
dream-formation by a recent but psychologically indifferent 
element, 
 provided the two following conditions are fulfilled: (i) 
the dream-content preserves a connection with things recently 
experienced;
 (2) the dream-stimulus is still a psychologically 
significant event.
 In one single case (a) both these conditions 
are fulfilled by the same impression.
 If we now consider that 
these same indifferent impressions, 
 which are utilized for the 
dream as long as they are recent, 
 lose this qualification as soon 
as they are a day (or at most several days) older, 
 we are obliged 
to assume that the very freshness of an impression gives it a 
certain psychological value for dream-formation, 
 somewhat 
equivalent to the value of emotionally accentuated memories or 
trains of thought.
 Later on, 
 in the light of certain psychological 
considerations, 
 we shall be able to divine the explanation of this 
importance of recent impressions in dream-formation .
 8 

Incidentally our attention is here called to the fact that at 
night, 
 and unnoticed by our consciousness, 
 important changes 
may occur in the material comprised by our ideas and memories.
 
The injunction that before making a final decision in any matter 
one should sleep on it for a night is obviously fully justified.
 But 
at this point we find that we have passed from the psychology 
of dreaming to the psychology of sleep, 
 a step which there will 
often be occasion to take.
 

At this point there arises an objection which threatens to 
invalidate the conclusions at which we have just arrived.
 If 
indifferent impressions can find their way into the dream only 
so long as they are of recent origin, 
 how does it happen that in 
the dream-content we find elements also from earlier periods of 
our lives, 
 which at the time when they were still recent possessed, 
 as Striimpell puts it, 
 no psychic value, 
 and which, 
 therefore, 
 ought to have been forgotten long ago ;
 elements, 
 that is, 
 
which are neither fresh nor psychologically significant? 

5 Cf, 
 Chap.
 VII on Transference.
 


This objection can be disposed of completely if we have 
recourse to the results of the psychoanalysis of neurotics.
 The 
solution is as follows: The process of shifting and rearrangement 
which replaces material of psychic significance by material which 
is indifferent (whether one is dreaming or thinking) has already 
taken place in these earlier periods of life, 
 and has since become 
fixed in the memory.
 Those elements which were originally indifferent are in fact no longer so, 
 since they have acquired the 
value of psychologically significant material.
 That which has 
actually remained indifferent can never be reproduced in the 
dream.
 

From the foregoing exposition the reader may rightly conclude that I assert that there are no indifferent dream-stimuli, 
 
and therefore no guileless dreams.
 This I absolutely and unconditionally believe to be the case, 
 apart from the dreams of children, 
 and perhaps the brief dream-reactions to nocturnal sensations.
 Apart from these exceptions, 
 whatever one dreams is 
either plainly recognizable as being psychically significant, 
 or 
it is distorted and can be judged correctly only after complete 
interpretation, 
 when it proves after all to be of psychic significance.
 The dream never concerns itself with trifles;
 we do 
not allow sleep to be disturbed by trivialities .
 0 Dreams which 
are apparently guileless turn out to be the reverse of innocent if 
one takes the trouble to interpret them;
 if I may be permitted 
the expression, 
 they all show the mark of the beast.
 Since this 
is another point on which I may expect contradiction, 
 and since 
I am glad of an opportunity to show dream-distortion at work, 
 
I shall here subject to analysis a number of guileless dreams 
from my collection.
 


I 

An intelligent and refined young woman, 
 who in real life is distinctly reserved, 
 one of those people of whom one says that still 
waters run deep, 
 relates the following dream: I dreamt that 1 
arrived at the market too late , 
 and could get nothing pom either 
the butcher or the greengrocer woman  Surely a guileless dream, 
 
but as it has not the appearance of a real dream I induce her to 
relate it in detail.
 Her report then runs as follows: She goes to 
the market with her cook, 
 who carries the basket .
 The butcher 
tells her , 
 after she has asked Mm for something : That is no 
longer to be obtained  and wants to give her something else, 
 
with the remark :  That is good , 
 too She refuses, 
 and goes to 
the greengrocer woman .
 The latter tries to sell her a peculiar 
vegetable, 
 which is bound up in bundles, 
 and is black in colour .
 
She says;
  I don’t know that, 
 I won’t take it.
 

The connection of the dream with the preceding day is simple 
enough.
 She had really gone to the market too late, 
 and had been 
unable to buy anything.
 The meat-shop was already closed, 
 comes 
into one’s mind as a description of the experience.
 But wait, 
 
is not that a very vulgar phrase which — or rather, 
 the opposite 
of which — denotes a certain neglect with regard to a man’s clothing? 10 The dreamer has not used these words;
 she has perhaps 
avoided them;
 but let us look for the interpretation of the details contained in the dream.
 

When in a dream something has the character of a spoken 
utterance — that is, 
 when it is said or heard, 
 not merely thought — 
and the distinction can usually be made with certainty — then it 
originates in the utterances of waking life, 
 which have, 
 of 
course, 
 been treated as raw material, 
 dismembered, 
 and slightly 
altered, 
 and above all removed from their context.
 11 In the work 
of interpretation we may take such utterances as our startingpoint.
 Where, 
 then, 
 does the butcher’s statement, 
 That is no 
longer to be obtained, 
 come from? From myself ;
 I had explained 
to her some days previously that the oldest experiences of 
childhood are no longer to be obtained as such, 
 but will be replaced in the analysis by ‘transferences’ and dreams.
 Thus, 
 I 
am the butcher;
 and she refuses to accept these transferences 
10 Its meaning is: Your fly is undone.
 (Trans.
) 

to the present of old ways of thinking and feeling.
 Where does 
her dream utterance, 
 1 don't know that, 
 1 won't take it, 
 come 
from? For the purposes of the analysis this has to be dissected.
 
I don’t know that she herself had said to her cook, 
 with whom 
she had a dispute on the previous day, 
 but she had then added: 
Behave yourself decently .
 Here a displacement is palpable;
 of 
the two sentences which she spoke to her cook, 
 she included the 
insignificant one in her dream;
 but the suppressed sentence, 
 
Behave yourself decently 1 alone fits in with die rest of the 
dream-content.
 One might use the words to a man who was 
making indecent overtures, 
 and had neglected to close his 
meat-shop.
 That we have really hit upon the trail of the interpretation is proved by its agreement with the allusions made 
by the incident with the greengrocer woman.
 A vegetable which 
is sold tied up in bundles (a longish vegetable, 
 as she subsequently adds), 
 and is also black;
 what can this be but a dreamcombination of asparagus and black radish? I need not interpret asparagus to the initiated;
 and the other vegetable, 
 too 
(think of the exclamation: Blacky, 
 save yourself 1), 
 seems to 
me to point to the sexual theme at which we guessed in the beginning, 
 wnen we wanted to replace the story of the dream by 
the meat-shop is closed.
 We are not here concerned with the 
full meaning of the dream;
 so much is certain, 
 that it is full of 
meaning and by no means guileless.
 13 

II 

Another guileless dream of the same patient, 
 which in some respects is a pendant to the above.
 Her husband asks her: 

12 For the curious, 
 I may remark that behind the dream there is hidden a 
phantasy of indecent, 
 sexually provoking conduct on my part, 
 and of repulsion on the part of the lady.
 If this interpretation should seem preposterous, 
 
I would remind the reader of the numerous cases in which physicians have 
been made the object of such charges by hysterical women, 
 with whom the 
same phantasy has not appeared in a distorted form as a dream, 
 but has 
become undisguisedly conscious and delusional.
 — With this dream the 
patient began her psychoanalytical treatment.
 It was only later that I 
learned that with this dream she repeated the initial trauma in which her 
neurosis originated, 
 and since then I have noticed the same behaviour in 
other persons who in their childhood were victims of sexual attacks, 
 and 
now, 
 as it were, 
 wish in their dreams for them to be repeated.
 

Oughtn’t we to have the piano tuned ? She replies: It’s not 
worth while , 
 the hammers would have to be rebuffed as well 
Again we have the reproduction of an actual event of the preceding day.
 Her husband had asked her such a question, 
 and 
she had answered it in such words.
 But what is the meaning of 
her dreaming it? She says of the piano that it is a disgusting old 
box which has a bad tone;
 it belonged to her husband before 
they were married , 
 13 etc.
, 
 but the key to the true solution lies in 
the phrase: It isn’t worth while .
 This has its origin in a call paid 
yesterday to a woman friend.
 She was asked to take off her coat, 
 
but declined, 
 saying: Thanks, 
 it isn’t worth while, 
 I must go in 
a moment.
 At this point I recall that yesterday, 
 during the 
analysis, 
 she suddenly took hold of her coat, 
 of which a button 
had come undone.
 It was as though she meant to say: Please 
don’t look in, 
 it isn’t worth while.
 Thus box becomes chest , 
 and 
the interpretation of the dream leads to the years when she was 
growing out of her childhood, 
 when she began to be dissatisfied 
with her figure.
 It leads us back, 
 indeed, 
 to earlier periods, 
 if 
we take into consideration the disgusting and the bad tone , 
 and 
remember how often in allusions and in dreams the two small 
hemispheres of the female body take the place — as a substitute 
and an antithesis — of the large ones.
 

I will interrupt the analysis of this dreamer in order to insert a 
short, 
 innocent dream which was dreamed by a young man.
 He 
dreamt that he was putting on his winter overcoat again;
 this 
was terrible .
 The occasion for this dream is apparently the sudden advent of cold weather.
 On more careful examination we 
note that the two brief fragments of the dream do not fit together very well, 
 for what could be terrible about wearing a 
thick or heavy coat in cold weather? Unfortunately for the innocency of this dream, 
 the first association, 
 under analysis, 
 
yields the recollection that yesterday a lady had confidentially 
confessed to him that her last child owed its existence to the 
splitting of a condom.
 He now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance 
with this suggestion: A thin condom is dangerous, 
 a 
thick one is bad.
 The condom is a pullover ( Uebcrzieher = 
literally pullover), 
 for it is pulled over something: and Uebersieher is the German term for a light overcoat.
 An experience 
like that related by the lady would indeed be terrible for an 
unmarried man.
 

We will now return to our other innocent dreamer.
 

IV 

She puts a candle into a candlestick;
 but the candle is broken, 
 so 
that it does not stand up.
 The girls at school say she is clumsy;
 
but she replies that it is not her fault.
 

Here, 
 too, 
 there is an actual occasion for the dream;
 the day 
before she had actually put a candle into a candlestick;
 but this 
one was not broken.
 An obvious symbolism has here been employed.
 The candle is an object which excites the female genitals;
 
its being broken, 
 so that it does not stand upright, 
 signifies impotence on the man’s part (if is not her fault).
 But does this 
young woman, 
 carefully brought up, 
 and a stranger to all 
obscenity, 
 know of such an application of the candle? By chance 
she is able to tell how she came by this information.
 While paddling a canoe on the Rhine, 
 a boat passed her which contained 
some students, 
 who were singing rapturously, 
 or rather yelling: 
When the Queen of Sweden, 
 behind closed shutters, 
 with the 
candles of Apollo.
 .
 .
 .
 

She does not hear or else understand the last word.
 Her husband was asked to give her the required explanation.
 These 
verses are then replaced in the dream-content by the innocent 
recollection of a task which she once performed clumsily at her 
boarding-school, 
 because of the closed shutters .
 The connection 
between the theme of masturbation and that of impotence is 
clear enough.
 Apollo in the latent dream-content connects this 
dream with an earlier one in which the virgin Pallas figured.
 All 
this is obviously not innocent.
 

V 

Lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from 
dreams concerning the dreamer’s real circumstances, 
 I add another 
dream originating with the same person, 
 which once more 
appears innocent, 
 I dreamt of doing something , 
 33 she relates, 
 
which I actually did during the day, 
 that is to say , 
 I filled a 
little trunk so full of books that I had difficulty in closing it.
 
My dream was just like the actual occurrence 33 Here the dreamer 
herself emphasizes the correspondence between the dream and 
the reality.
 All such criticisms of the dream, 
 and comments on 
the dream, 
 although they have found a place in the waking 
thoughts, 
 properly belong to the latent dream-content, 
 as further 
examples will confirm.
 We are told, 
 then, 
 that what the dream 
relates has actually occurred during the day.
 It would take us 
too far afield to show how we arrive at the idea of making use 
of the English language to help us in the interpretation of this 
dream.
 Suffice it to say that it is again a question of a little box 
(cf.
 p.
 62, 
 the dream of the dead child in the box) which has 
been filled so full that nothing can go into it.
 

In all these innocent dreams the sexual factor as the motive 
of the censorship is very prominent.
 But this is a subject of 
primary significance, 
 which we must consider later.
 


B.
 INFANTILE EXPERIENCES AS 
THE SOURCE OF DREAMS 

As the third of the peculiarities of the dream-content, 
 we have 
adduced the fact, 
 in agreement with all other writers on the 
subject (excepting Robert), 
 that impressions from our childhood 
may appear in dreams, 
 which do not seem to be at the disposal 
of the waking memory.
 It is, 
 of course, 
 difficult to decide how 
seldom or how frequently this occurs, 
 because after waking the 
origin of the respective elements of the dream is not recognized.
 
The proof that we are dealing with impressions of our childhood 
must thus be adduced objectively, 
 and only in rare instances do 
the conditions favour such proof.
 The story is told by A.
 Maury, 
 
as being particularly conclusive, 
 of a man who decides to visit 
his birthplace after an absence of twenty years.
 On the night 
before his departure he dreams that he is in a totally unfamiliar 
locality, 
 and that he there meets a strange man with whom he 
holds a conversation.
 Subsequently, 
 upon his return home, 
 he is 
able to convince himself that this strange locality really exists 
in the vicinity of his home, 
 and the strange man in the dream 
turns out to be a Mend of his dead father’s, 
 who is living in the 
town.
 This is, 
 of course, 
 a conclusive proof that in his childhood 
he had seen both the man and the locality.
 The dream, 
 moreover, 
 is to be interpreted as a dream of impatience, 
 like the 
dream of the girl who carries in her pocket her ticket for a concert, 
 the dream of the child whose father had promised him an 
excursion to the Hameau (p.
 40), 
 and so forth.
 The motives 
which reproduce just these impressions of childhood for the 
dreamer cannot, 
 of course, 
 be discovered without analysis.
 

One of my colleagues, 
 who attended my lectures, 
 and who 
boasted that his dreams were very rarely subject to distortion, 
 
told me that he had sometime previously seen, 
 in a dream, 
 his 
former tutor in bed with his nurse, 
 who had remained in the 
household until his eleventh year.
 The actual location of this 
scene was realized even in the dream.
 As he was greatly interested, 
 he related the dream to his elder brother, 
 who laughingly 
confirmed its reality.
 The brother said that he remembered the 
affair very distinctly, 
 for he was six years old at the time.
 The 
lovers were in the habit of making him, 
 the elder boy, 
 drunk with 
beer whenever circumstances were favourable to their nocturnal 
intercourse.
 The younger child, 
 our dreamer, 
 at that time three 
years of age, 
 slept in the same room as the nurse, 
 but was not 
regarded as an obstacle.
 

In yet another case it may be definitely established, 
 without 
the aid of dream-interpretation, 
 that the dream contains elements from childhood — namely, 
 if the dream is a so-called 
perennial dream, 
 one which, 
 being first dreamt in childhood, 
 
recurs again and again in adult years.
 I may add a few examples 
of this sort to those already known, 
 although I have no personal 
knowledge of perennial dreams.
 A physician, 
 in his thirties, 
 tells 
me that a yellow lion, 
 concerning which he is able to give the 
precisest information, 
 has often appeared in his dream-life, 
 from 
his earliest childhood up to the present day.
 This lion, 
 known 
to him from his dreams, 
 was one day discovered in natura, 
 as a 
long-forgotten china animal.
 The young man then learned from 
his mother that the lion had been his favourite toy in early childhood, 
 a fact which he himself could no longer remember.
 

If we now turn from the manifest dream-content to the dreamthoughts which are revealed only on analysis, 
 the experiences of 
childhood may be found to recur even in dreams whose content 
would not have led us to suspect anything of the sort.
 I owe a 
particularly delightful and instructive example of such a dream 
to my esteemed colleague of the yellow lion.
 After reading 
Nansen’s account of his polar expedition, 
 he dreamt that he was 
giving the intrepid explorer electrical treatment on an ice-floe 
for the sciatica of which the latter complained! During the analysis of this dream he remembered an incident of his childhood, 
 
without which the dream would be wholly unintelligible.
 When 
he was three or four years of age he was one day listening attentively to the conversation of his elders;
 they were talking of 
exploration, 
 and he presently asked his father whether exploration was a bad illness.
 He had apparently confounded Reisen 
(journey, 
 trips) with Reissen (gripes, 
 tearing pains), 
 and the 
derision of his brothers and sisters prevented his ever forgetting 
the humiliating experience.
 

We have a precisely similar case when, 
 in the analysis of the 
dream of the monograph on the genus cyclamen, 
 I stumble upon 
a memory, 
 retained from childhood, 
 to the effect that when I 
was five years old my father allowed me to destroy a book embellished with coloured plates.
 It will perhaps be doubted 
whether this recollection really entered into the composition of 
the dream-content, 
 and it may be suggested that the connection 
was established subsequently by the analysis.
 But the abundance 
and intricacy of the associative connections vouch for the truth 
of my explanation: cyclamen — favourite flower — favourite dish 
— artichoke;
 to pick to pieces like an artichoke, 
 leaf by leaf (a 
phrase which at that time one heard daily, 
 a propos of the dividing up of the Chinese empire) ;
 herbarium — bookworm, 
 whose 
favourite food is books.
 I can further assure the reader that the 
ultimate meaning of the dream, 
 which I have not given here, 
 is 
most intimately connected with the content of the scene of 
childish destruction.
 

In another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the 
very wish which has given rise to the dream, 
 and whose fulfilment 
the dream proves to be, 
 has itself originated in childhood, 
 so 
that one is astonished to find that the child with all his impulses 
survives in the dream .
 

1 shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has 
already proved instructive: I refer to the dream in which my 
friend R.
 is my unde.
 We have carried its interpretation far 
enough for the wish-motive — the wish to be appointed professor — to assert itself palpably;
 and we have explained the affection felt for my friend R.
 in the dream as the outcome of 
apposition to, 
 and defiance of, 
 the two colleagues who appear in 
the dream-thoughts.
 The dream was my own;
 I may, 
 therefore, 
 
continue the analysis by stating that I did not feel quite satisfied 
with the solution arrived at.
 I knew that my opinion of these 
colleagues, 
 who were so badly treated in my dream-thoughts, 
 
would have been expressed in very different language in my 
waking life;
 the intensity of the wish that I might not share 
their fate as regards the appointment seemed to me too slight 
fully to account for the discrepancy between my dream-opinion 
and my waking opinion.
 If the desire to be addressed by another 
title were really so intense it would be proof of a morbid ambition, 
 which I do not think I cherish, 
 and which I believe I was 
far from entertaining.
 I do not know how others who think they 
know me would judge me;
 perhaps I really was ambitious;
 but 
if I was, 
 my ambition has long since been transferred to objects 
other than the rank and title of Professor cxlraordinarius.
 

Whence, 
 then, 
 the ambition which the dream has ascribed to 
me? Here I am reminded of a story which I heard often in my 
childhood, 
 that at my birth an old peasant woman had prophesied to my happy mother (whose first-born I was) that she had 
brought a great man into the world.
 Such prophecies must be 
made very frequently;
 there are so many happy and expectant 
mothers, 
 and so many old peasant women, 
 and other old women 
who, 
 since their mundane powers have deserted them, 
 turn their 
eyes toward the future;
 and the prophetess is not likely to suffer 
for her prophecies.
 Is it possible that my thirst for greatness has 
originated from this source? But here I recollect an impression 
from the later years of my childhood, 
 which might serve even 
better as an explanation.
 One evening, 
 at a restaurant on the 
Prater, 
 where my parents were accustomed to take me when 
I was eleven or twelve years of age, 
 we noticed a man who was 
going from table to table and, 
 for a small sum, 
 improvising 
verses upon any subject that was given him.
 I was sent to bring 
the poet to our table, 
 and he showed his gratitude.
 Before asking for a subject he threw off a few rhymes about myself, 
 and 
told us that if he could trust his inspiration I should probably 
one day become a minister.
 I can still distinctly remember the 
impression produced by this second prophecy.
 It was in the days 
of the bourgeois Ministry;
 my father had recently brought 
home the portraits of the bourgeois university graduates, 
 Herbst, 
 
Giskra, 
 Unger, 
 Berger and others, 
 and we illuminated the house 
in their honour.
 There were even Jews among them;
 so that 
every diligent Jewish schoolboy carried a ministerial portfolio in 
his satchel.
 The impression of that time must be responsible for 
the fact that until shortly before I went to the university I 
wanted to study jurisprudence, 
 and changed my mind only at 
the last moment.
 A medical man has no chance of becoming a 
minister.
 And now for my dream: It is only now that I begin 
to see that it translates me from the somber present to the 
hopeful days of the bourgeois Ministry, 
 and completely fulfils 
what was then my youthful ambition.
 In treating my two estimable and learned colleagues, 
 merely because they are Jews, 
 
so badly, 
 one as though he were a simpleton, 
 and the other as 
though he were a criminal, 
 I am acting as though I were the 
Minister;
 I have put myself in his place.
 What a revenge I take 
upon his Excellency! He refuses to appoint me Professor ex~ 
traordinarius , 
 and so in my dream I put myself in his place.
 

In another case I note the fact that although the wish that 
excites the dream is a contemporary wish it is nevertheless 
greatly reinforced by memories of childhood.
 I refer to a series 
of dreams which are based on the longing to go to Rome.
 For 
a long time to come I shall probably have to satisfy this longing 
by means of dreams, 
 since at the season of the year when I 
should be able to travel Rome is to be avoided for reasons of 
health .
 14 Thus I once dreamt that I saw the Tiber and the bridge 
of Saint’ Angelo from the window of a railway carriage;
 presently the train started, 
 and I realized that I had never entered 
the city at all.
 The view that appeared in the dream was 
modelled after a well-known engraving which I had casually 
noticed the day before in the drawing-room of one of my patients.
 In another dream someone took me up a hill and showed 
me Rome half shrouded in mist, 
 and so distant that I was 
astonished at the distinctness of the view.
 The content of this 
dream is too rich to be fully reported here.
 The motive, 
 to see 
the promised land afar, 
 is here easily recognizable.
 The city 
which I thus saw in the midst is Liibeck;
 the original of the hill 
is the Gleichenberg.
 In a third dream I am at last in Rome.
 To 
my disappointment the scenery is anything but urban: it consists of a little stream of black water, 
 on one side of which are 
black rocks, 
 while on the other are meadows with large white 
flowers.
 I notice a certain Herr Zucker ( with whom I am superficially acquainted), 
 and resolve to ask him to show me the way 
into the city.
 It is obvious that I am trying in vain Msec in my 
dream a city which I have never seen in my waking life.
 If I 
resolve the landscape into its elements, 
 the white flowers point 
to Ravenna, 
 which is known to me, 
 and which once, 
 for a time, 
 
replaced Rome as the capital of Italy.
 In the marshes around 
Ravenna we had found the most beautiful water-lilies in the 
midst of black pools of water;
 the dream makes them grow in 
the meadows, 
 like the narcissi of our own Aussee, 
 because we 
found it so troublesome to cull them from the water.
 The black 
rock so close to the water vividly recalls the valley of the Tepl 
at Karlsbad.
 Karlsbad now enables me to account for the 
peculiar circumstance that I ask Herr Zucker to show me the 
way.
 In the material of which the dream is woven I am able to 
recognize two of those amusing Jewish anecdotes which conceal 
such profound and, 
 at times, 
 such bitter worldly wisdom, 
 and 
which we are so fond of quoting in our letters and conversation.
 
One is the story of the constitution;
 it tells how a poor Jew 
sneaks into the Karlsbad express without a ticket;
 how he is 
detected, 
 and is treated more and more harshly by the conductor 
at each succeeding call for tickets;
 and how, 
 when a friend whom 
he meets at one of the stations during his miserable journey asks 
him where he is going, 
 he answers: To Karlsbad — if my constitution holds out.
 Associated in memory with this is another 
story about a Jew who is ignorant of French, 
 and who has express instructions to ask in Paris for the Rue Richelieu.
 Paris 
was for many years the goal of my own longing, 
 and I regarded 
the satisfaction with which I first set foot on the pavements of 
Paris as a warrant that I should attain to the fulfilment of other 
wishes also.
 Moreover, 
 asking the way is a direct allusion to 
Rome, 
 for, 
 as we know, 
 all roads lead to Rome.
 And further, 
 
the name Zucker (sugar) again points to Karlsbad, 
 whither we 
send persons afflicted with the constitutional disease, 
 diabetes 
(Zucker krankheit, 
 sugar-disease).
 The occasion for this dream 
was the proposal of my Berlin friend that we should meet in 
Prague at Easter.
 A further association with sugar and diabetes 
might be found in the matters which I had to discuss with him.
 

A fourth dream, 
 occurring shortly after the last-mentioned, 
 
brings me back to Rome.
 I see a street comer before me, 
 and am 
astonished that so many German placards should be posted 
there.
 On the previous day, 
 when writing to my friend, 
 I had 
told him, 
 with truly prophetic vision, 
 that Prague would probably not be a comfortable place for German travellers.
 The 
dream, 
 therefore, 
 expressed simultaneously the wish to meet him 
in Rome instead of in the Bohemian capital, 
 and the desire, 
 
which probably originated during my student days, 
 that the 
German language might be accorded more tolerance in Prague.
 
As a matter of fact, 
 I must have understood the Czech language 
in the first years of my childhood, 
 for I was born in a small 
village in Moravia, 
 amidst a Slav population.
 A Czech nursery 
rhyme, 
 which I heard in my seventeenth year, 
 became, 
 without 
effort on my part, 
 so imprinted upon my memory that I can 
repeat it to this day, 
 although I have no idea of its meaning.
 
Thus in these dreams also there is no lack of manifold relations 
to the impressions of my early childhood.
 

During my last Italian journey, 
 which took me past Lake 
Trasimenus, 
 I at length discovered, 
 after I had seen the Tiber, 
 
and had reluctantly turned back some fifty miles from Rome, 
 
what a reinforcement my longing for the Eternal City had received from the impressions of my childhood.
 I had just conceived a plan of travelling to Naples via Rome the following 
year when this sentence, 
 which I must have read in one of our 
German classics, 
 occurred to me : 15 It is a question which of the 
two paced to and fro in his room the more impatiently after he 
had conceived the plan of going to Rome — -Assistant Headmaster 
Winckelmann or the great General Hannibal.
 I myself had 
walked in Hannibars footsteps;
 like him I was destined never 
to see Rome, 
 and he too had gone to Campania when all were 
expecting him in Rome.
 Hannibal, 
 with whom I had achieved 
this point of similarity, 
 had been my favourite hero during my 
years at the gymnasium;
 like so many boys of my age, 
 I bestowed my sympathies in the Punic war not on the Romans, 
 but 
on the Cathaginians.
 Moreover, 
 when I finally came to realize 
the consequences of belonging to an alien race, 
 and was forced 
by the anti-Semitic feeling among my class-mates to take a 
definite stand, 
 the figure of the Semitic commander assumed still 
greater proportions in my imagination.
 Hannibal and Rome symbolized, 
 in my youthful eyes, 
 the struggle between the tenacity 
of the Jews and the organization of the Catholic Church.
 The 
significance for our emotional life which the anti-Semitic movement has since assumed helped to fix the thoughts and impressions of those earlier days.
 Thus the desire to go to Rome has in 
my dream-life become the mask and symbol for a number of 
warmly cherished wishes, 
 for whose realization one had to work 
with the tenacity and single-mindedness of the Punic general, 
 
though their fulfilment at times seemed as remote as Hannibal’s 
lifelong wish to enter Rome.
 

And now, 
 for the first time, 
 I happened upon the youthful 
experience which even to-day still expresses its power in all these 
emotions and dreams.
 I might have been ten or twelve years old 
when my father began to take me with him on his walks, 
 and in 
his conversation to reveal his views on the things of this world.
 

18 The writer in whose works I found this passage was probably Jean Paul 
Richter.
 

Thus it was that he once told me the following incident, 
 in order 
to show me that I had been born into happier times than he: 
<f When I was a young man, 
 I was walking one Saturday along 
the street in the village where you were born;
 I was well-dressed, 
 
with a new fur cap on my head.
 Up comes a Christian, 
 who 
knocks my cap into the mud, 
 and shouts, 
 ‘Jew, 
 get off the pavementl 5 55 — And what did you do? — I went into the street and 
picked up the cap, 
 he calmly replied.
 That did not seem heroic 
on the part of the big, 
 strong man who was leading me, 
 a little 
fellow, 
 by the hand.
 I contrasted this situation, 
 which did not 
please me, 
 with another, 
 more in harmony with my sentiments — 
the scene in which Hannibal's father, 
 Hamilcar Barcas, 
 made 
his son swear before the household altar to take vengeance on 
the Romans .
 16 Ever since then Hannibal has had a place in my 
phantasies.
 

I think I can trace my enthusiasm for the Carthaginian general still further back into my childhood, 
 so that it is probably 
only an instance of an already established emotional relation 
being transferred to a new vehicle.
 One of the first books which 
fell into my childish hands after I learned to read was Thiers 5 
Consulate and Empire .
 I remember that I pasted on the flat 
backs of my wooden soldiers little labels bearing the names of 
the Imperial marshals, 
 and that at that time Massena (as a 
Jew, 
 Menasse) was already my avowed favourite .
 17 This preference is doubtless also to be explained by the fact of my having 
been born a hundred years later, 
 on the same date.
 Napoleon 
himself is associated with Hannibal through the crossing of the 
Alps.
 And perhaps the development of this martial ideal may be 
traced yet farther back, 
 to the first three years of my childhood, 
 
to wishes which my alternately friendly and hostile relations 
with a boy a year older than myself must have evoked in the 
weaker of the two playmates.
 

The deeper we go into the analysis of dreams, 
 the more often 
are we put on to the track of childish experiences which play the 
part of dream-sources in the latent dream-content.
 

We have learned that dreams very rarely reproduce memories 
in such a manner as to constitute, 
 unchanged and unabridged, 
 
the sole manifest dream-content.
 Nevertheless, 
 a few authentic 
examples which show such reproduction have been recorded, 
 
and I can add a few new ones, 
 which once more refer to scenes 
of childhood.
 In the case of one of my patients a dream once 
gave a barely distorted reproduction of a sexual incident, 
 which 
was immediately recognized as an accurate recollection.
 The 
memory of it had never been completely lost in the waking life, 
 
but it had been greatly obscured, 
 and it was revivified by the 
previous work of analysis.
 The dreamer had at the age of twelve 
visited a bedridden schoolmate, 
 who had exposed himself, 
 probably only by a chance movement in bed.
 At the sight of the 
boy’s genitals he was seized by a kind of compulsion, 
 exposed 
himself, 
 and took hold of the member of the other boy- who, 
 
however, 
 looked at him in surprise and indignation, 
 whereupon 
he became embarrassed and let it go.
 A dream repeated this 
scene twenty-three years later, 
 with all the details of the accompanying emotions, 
 changing it, 
 however, 
 in this respect, 
 that 
the dreamer played the passive instead of the active role, 
 while 
the person of the schoolmate was replaced by a contemporary.
 

As a rule, 
 of course, 
 a scene from childhood is represented in 
the manifest dream-content only by an illusion, 
 and must be 
disentangled from the dream by interpretation.
 The citation of 
examples of this kind cannot be very convincing, 
 because any 
guarantee that they are really experiences of childhood is lacking;
 if they belong to an earlier period of life, 
 they are no 
longer recognized by our memory.
 The conclusion that such 
childish experiences recur at all in dreams is justified in psychoanalytic work by a great number of factors, 
 which in their combined results appear to be sufficiently reliable.
 But when, 
 for the 
purposes of dream-interpretation, 
 such references to childish experiences are torn out of their context, 
 they may not perhaps 
seem very impressive, 
 especially where I do not even give all 
the material upon which the interpretation is based.
 However, 
 I 
shall not let this deter me from giving a few examples.
 



THE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS 


IOI 


I 

With one of my female patients all dreams have the character of 
hurry;
 she is hurrying so as to be in time, 
 so as not to miss 
her train, 
 and so on.
 In one dream she has to visit a girl friend;
 
her mother had told her to ride and not walk;
 she runs , 
 however , 
 
and keeps on calling .
 The material that emerged in the analysis 
allowed one to recognize a memory of childish romping, 
 and, 
 
especially for one dream, 
 went back to the popular childish game 
of rapidly repeating the words of a sentence as though it was 
all one word.
 All these harmless jokes with little friends were 
remembered because they replaced other less harmless ones.
 18 

II 

The following dream was dreamed by another female patient: 
She is in a large room in which there are all sorts of machines;
 
it is rather like what she would imagine an orthopaedic institute 
to be .
 She hears that 1 am pressed for time , 
 and that she must 
undergo treatment along with five others.
 But she resists , 
 and 
is unwilling to lie down on the bed — or whatever it is — which is 
intended for her .
 She stands in a corner , 
 and waits for me to say 
It is not true.
 The others, 
 meanwhile, 
 laugh at her, 
 saying it 
is all foolishness on her part.
 At the same time , 
 it is as though 
she were called upon to make a number of little squares.
 

The first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to the 
treatment and to the transference 19 to myself.
 The second contains an allusion to a scene of childhood;
 the two portions are 
connected by the mention of the bed.
 The orthopaedic institute 
is an allusion to one of my talks, 
 in which I compared the treatment, 
 with regard to its duration and its nature, 
 to an orthopaedic treatment.
 At the beginning of the treatment I had to tell 
her that for the present I had little time to give her, 
 but that 
later on I would devote a whole hour to her daily.
 This aroused 
in her the old sensitiveness, 
 which is a leading characteristic of 
children who are destined to become hysterical.
 Their desire for 
love is insatiable.
 My patient was the youngest of six brothers 
and sisters (hence, 
 with five others), 
 and as such her father’s 
favourite, 
 but in spite of this she seems to have felt that her 
beloved father devoted far too little time and attention to her.
 
Her waiting for me to say It is not true was derived as follows: A little tailor’s apprentice had brought her a dress, 
 and 
she had given him the money for it.
 Then she asked her husband 
whether she would have to pay the money again if the boy were 
to lose it.
 To tease her, 
 her husband answered Yes (the 
teasing in the dream) , 
 and she asked again and again, 
 and waited 
for him to say It is not true.
 The thought of the latent dreamcontent may now be construed as follows: Will she have to pay 
me double the amount when I devote twice as much time to her? 
— a thought which is stingy or filthy (the uncleanliness of childhood is often replaced in dreams by greed for money;
 the word 
filthy here supplies the bridge) .
 If all the passage referring 
to her waiting until I say It is not true is intended in the 
dream as a circumlocution for the word dirty, 
 the standingin-thc-corncr and not lying-down-on-the-bcd are in keeping with 
this world, 
 as component parts of a scene of her childhood in 
which she had soiled her bed, 
 in punishment for which she was 
■put into the corner, 
 with a warning that papa would not love her 
any more, 
 whereupon her brothers and sisters laughed at her, 
 
etc.
 The little squares refer to her young niece, 
 who showed her 
the arithmetical trick of writing figures in nine squares (I think) 
in such a way that on being added together in any direction they 
make fifteen.
 


ra 

Here is a man’s dream: He sees two boys tussling with each other;
 
they are cooper’s boys, 
 as he concludes from the tools which are 
lying about;
 one of the boys has thrown the other down;
 the 
prostrate boy is wearing ear-rings with blue stones.
 He runs towards the assailant with lifted cane, 
 in order to chastise him.
 
The boy takes refuge behind a woman, 
 as though she were his 
mother, 
 who is standing against a wooden fence .
 She is the wife 
of a day-labourer, 
 and she turns her back to the man who is 
dreaming.
 Finally she turns about and stares at him with a horrible look, 
 so that he runs away in terror;
 the red flesh of the 
lower lid seems to stand out from her eyes .
 

This dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences 
from the previous day, 
 in the course of which he actually saw 
two boys in the street, 
 one of whom threw the other down.
 When 
he walked up to them in order to settle the quarrel, 
 both of them 
took to cheir heels.
 Cooper’s boys — this is explained only by a 
subsequent dream, 
 in the analysis of which he used the proverbial 
expression: To knock the bottom out of the barrel Ear-rings 
with blue stones, 
 according to his observation, 
 are worn chiefly 
by prostitutes .
 This suggests a familiar doggerel rhyme about 
two boys: The other boy was called Marie: that is, 
 he was a 
girl.
 The woman standing by the fence: after the scene with the 
two boys he went for a walk along the bank of the Danube and, 
 
taking advantage of being alone, 
 urinated against a wooden 
fence.
 A little farther on a respectably dressed, 
 elderly lady 
smiled at him very pleasantly, 
 and wanted to hand him her card 
with her address.
 

Since, 
 in the dream, 
 the woman stood as he had stood while 
urinating, 
 there is an allusion to a woman urinating, 
 and this 
explains the horrible look and the prominence of the red flesh, 
 
which can only refer to the genitals gaping in a squatting posture;
 seen in childhood, 
 they had appeared in later recollection 
as proud flesh  as a wound The dream unites two occasions 
upon which, 
 as a little boy, 
 the dreamer was enabled to see the 
genitals of little girls, 
 once by throwing the little girl down, 
 and 
once while the child was urinating ;
 and, 
 as is shown by another 
association, 
 he had retained in his memory the punishment administered or threatened by his father on account of these manifestations of sexual curiosity.
 


IV 

A great mass of childish memories, 
 which have been hastily 
combined into a phantasy, 
 may be found behind the following 
dream of an elderly lady: She goes out in a hurry to do some 
shopping.
 On the Graben 30 she sinks to her knees as though she 
had broken down .
 A number of people collect around her , 
 especially cab-drivers, 
 but no one helps her to get up.
 She makes 
many vain attempts;
 finally she must have succeeded, 
 for she is 
put into a cab which is to take her home .
 A large, 
 heavily laden 
basket (something like a market-basket) is thrown after her 
through the window .
 

This is the woman who is always harassed in her dreams, 
 just 
as she used to be harassed when a child.
 The first situation of the 
dream is apparently taken from the sight of a fallen horse, 
 just as 
broken down points to horse-racing.
 In her youth she was a 
rider;
 still earlier she was probably also a horse .
 With the idea 
of falling down is connected her first childish reminiscence of 
the seventeen-year-old son of the hall porter, 
 who had an epileptic seizure in the street and was brought home in a cab.
 Of 
this, 
 of course, 
 she had only heard, 
 but the idea of epileptic fits, 
 
of falling down, 
 acquired a great influence over her phantasies, 
 
and later on influenced the form of her own hysterical attacks.
 
When a person of the female sex dreams of falling, 
 this almost 
always has a sexual significance;
 she becomes a <{ fallen woman 
and, 
 for the purpose of the dream under consideration, 
 this interpretation is probably the least doubtful, 
 for she falls in the 
Graben, 
 the street in Vienna which is known as the concourse of 
prostitutes.
 The market-basket admits of more than one interpretation;
 in the sense of refusal (German, 
 Korb = basket = 
snub, 
 refusal) it reminds her of the many snubs which she at 
first administered to her suitors and which, 
 she thinks, 
 she herself received later.
 This agrees with the detail: no one tvill help 
her up, 
 which she herself interprets as being disdained.
 Further, 
 the market-basket recalls phantasies which have already 
appeared in the course of analysis, 
 in which she imagines that 
she has married far beneath her station and now goes to the 
market as a market-woman.
 Lastly, 
 the market-basket might be 
interpreted as the mark of a servant .
 This suggests further 
memories of her childhood — of a cook who was discharged because 
she stole ;
 she, 
 too, 
 sank to her knees and begged for mercy.
 
The dreamer was at that time twelve years of age.
 Then emerge? 
a recollection of a chamber-maid, 
 who was dismissed because 
she had an affair with the coachman of the household, 
 who, 
 incidentally, 
 married her afterwards.
 This recollection, 
 therefore, 
 
gives us a clue to the cab-drivers in the dream (who, 
 in opposition 
to the reality, 
 do not stand by the fallen woman).
 But there 
still remains to be explained the throwing of the basket;
 in particular, 
 why is it thrown through the window? This reminds her 
of the forwarding of luggage by rail, 
 to the custom of Fensterln 21 
in the country, 
 and to trivial impressions of a summer resort, 
 of 
a gentleman w T ho threw some blue plums into the window of a 
lady’s room, 
 and of her little sister, 
 who was frightened because 
an idiot who was passing looked in at the window.
 And now, 
 
from behind all this emerges an obscure recollection from her 
tenth year of a nurse in the country to whom one of the menservants made love (and whose conduct the child may have 
noticed), 
 and who was sent packing, 
 thrown out, 
 together 
with her lover (in the dream we have the expression: thrown 
into) ;
 an incident which we have been approaching by several 
other paths.
 The luggage or box of a servant is disparagingly 
described in Vienna as seven plums.
 Pack up your seven 
plums and get out! 

My collection, 
 of course, 
 contains a plethora of such patients 7 
dreams, 
 the analysis of which leads back to impressions of child* 
hood, 
 often dating back to the first three years of life, 
 which 
are remembered obscurely, 
 or not at all.
 But it is a questionable 
proceeding to draw conclusions from these and apply them to 
dreams in general, 
 for they are mostly dreams of neurotic, 
 and 
especially hysterical, 
 persons;
 and the part played in these 
dreams by childish scenes might be conditioned by the nature of 
the neurosis, 
 and not by the nature of dreams in general.
 In the 
interpretation of my own dreams, 
 however, 
 which is assuredly 
not undertaken on account of grave symptoms of illness, 
 it happens just as frequently that in the latent dream-content I am 
unexpectedly confronted with a scene of my childhood, 
 and that 
a whole series of my dreams will suddenly converge upon the 
paths proceeding from a single childish experience.
 I have already given examples of this, 
 and I shall give yet more in different connections.
 Perhaps I cannot close this chapter more fittingly than by citing several dreams of my own, 
 in which recent 
events and long-forgotten experiences of my childhood appear 
together as dream-sources.
 

I.
 After I have been travelling, 
 and have gone to bed hungry 
and tired, 
 the prime necessities of life begin to assert their claims 
in sleep, 
 and I dream as follows: I go into a kitchen in order to 
ask for some pudding.
 There three women are standing, 
 one of 
whom is the hostess;
 she is rolling something in her hands, 
 as 
though she were making dumplings.
 She replies that I must wait 
until she has finished (not distinctly as a speech).
 I become 
impatient, 
 and go away affronted.
 I want to put on an overcoat;
 
but the first I try on is too long.
 I take it off, 
 and ant somewhat 
astonished to find that it is trimmed with fur.
 A second coat has 
a long strip of cloth with a Turkish design sewn into it.
 A stranger 
with a long face and a short, 
 pointed beard comes up and prevents me from putting it on, 
 declaring that it belongs to him .
 I 
now show him that it is covered all over with Turkish embroideries.
 He asks :  How do the Turkish (drawings, 
 strips of cloth 
.

) concern you? But we soon become quite friendly.
 

In the analysis of this dream I remember, 
 quite unexpectedly, 
 
the first novel which I ever read, 
 or rather, 
 which I began to read 
from the end of the first volume, 
 when I was perhaps thirteen 
years of age.
 I have never learned the name of the novel, 
 or that 
of its author, 
 but the end remains vividly in my memory.
 The 
hero becomes insane, 
 and continually calls out the names of the 
three women who have brought the greatest happiness and the 
greatest misfortune into his life.
 Pelagie is one of these names.
 
I still do not know what to make of this recollection during the 
analysis.
 Together with the three women there now emerge the 
three Parcae, 
 who spin the fates of men, 
 and I know that one oi 
the three women, 
 the hostess in the dream, 
 is the mother who 
gives life and who, 
 moreover, 
 as in my own case, 
 gives the child 
its first nourishment.
 Love and hunger meet at the mother’s 
breast.
 A young man — so runs an anecdote— who became a 
great admirer of womanly beauty, 
 once observed, 
 when the conversation turned upon the handsome wet-nurse who had suckled 
him as a child, 
 that he was sorry that he had not taken better 
advantage of his opportunities.
 I am in the habit of using the 
anecdote to elucidate the factor of retrospective tendencies in 
the mechanism of the psychoneuroses.
 — One of the Parcae, 
 then, 
 
is rubbing the palms of her hands together, 
 as though she were 
making dumplings.
 A strange occupation for one of the Fates, 
 
and urgently in need of explanation! This explanation is furnished by another and earlier memory of my childhood.
 When 
I was six years old, 
 and receiving my first lessons from my 
mother, 
 I was expected to believe that we are made of dust, 
 and 
must, 
 therefore, 
 return to dust.
 But this did not please me, 
 and 
I questioned the doctrine.
 Thereupon my mother rubbed the 
palms of her hands together — just as in making dumplings, 
 
except that there was no dough between them — and showed me 
the blackish scales of epidermis which were thus rubbed off, 
 as 
a proof that it is of dust that we are made.
 Great was my astonishment at this demonstration ad oculos, 
 and I acquiesced in the 
idea which I was later to hear expressed in the words: Thou 
owest nature a death .
 22 Thus the women to whom I go in the 
kitchen, 
 as I so often did in my childhood when I was hungry 
and my mother, 
 sitting by the fire, 
 admonished me to wait until 
lunch was ready, 
 are really the Parcae.
 And now for the dumplings! At least one of my teachers at the University — the very 
one to whom I am indebted for my histological knowledge {epidermis ) — would be reminded by the name Knodl {Knodl means 
dumpling), 
 of a person whom he had to prosecute for plagiarising his writings.
 Committing a plagiarism, 
 taking anything one 
can lay hands on, 
 even though it belongs to another, 
 obviously 
leads to the second part of the dream, 
 in which 1 am treated like 
the overcoat thief who for some time plied his trade in the 
lecture-halls.
 I have written the word plagiarism — without definite intention — because it occurred to me, 
 and now I see that it 
must belong to the latent dream-content and that it will serve 
as a bridge between the different parts of the manifest dreamcontent.
 The chain of associations — Pilagic — plagiarism — plagiostomi 23 (sharks) — fish-bladder — connects the old novel with 
the affair of Knodl and the overcoats (German: Uberzieker = 
pullover, 
 overcoat or condom) , 
 which obviously refer to an appliance appertaining to the technique of sex.
 This, 
 it is true, 
 is 
a very forced and irrational connection, 
 but it is nevertheless 
one which I could not have established in waking life if it had 
not already been established by the dream-work.
 Indeed, 
 as 
though nothing were sacred to this impulse to enforce associations, 
 the beloved name, 
 Briicke (bridge of words, 
 see above), 
 
now serves to remind me of the very institute in which I spent 
my happiest hours as a student, 
 wanting for nothing.
 So will 
you at the breasts of Wisdom every day more pleasure find) , 
 
in the most complete contrast to the desires which plague me 
(German: plagcn) while I dream.
 And finally, 
 there emerges 
the recollection of another dear teacher, 
 whose name once more 
sounds like something edible ( Fleischl — Fleisch = meat — like 
Knodl = dumplings), 
 and of a pathetic scene in which the 
scales of epidermis play a part (mother — hostess), 
 and mental 
derangement (the novel), 
 and a remedy from the Latin pharmacopeia ( Kiiche — kitchen) which numbs the sensation of 
hunger, 
 namely, 
 cocaine.
 

In this manner I could follow the intricate trains of thought 
still farther, 
 and could fully elucidate that part of the dream 
which is lacking in the analysis;
 but I must refrain, 
 because the 
personal sacrifice which this would involve is too great.
 I shall 
take up only one of the threads, 
 which will serve to lead us directly to one of the dream-thoughts that lie at the bottom of the 
medley.
 The stranger with the long face and pointed beard, 
 who 
wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat, 
 has the features of a tradesman of Spalato, 
 of whom my wife bought a 
great deal of Turkish cloth.
 His name was Popovic, 
 a suspicious 
name, 
 which even gave the humorist Stettenheim a pretext for 
a suggestive remark: He told me his name, 
 and blushingly 
shook my hand.
- 1 For the rest, 
 I find the same misuse of names 
as above in the case of Pilagie, 
 Knodl, 
 Briicke, 
 Fleischl.
 No one 
will deny that such playing with names is a childish trick;
 if I 
indulge in it the practice amounts to an act of retribution, 
 for 
my own name has often enough been the subject of such feeble 
attempts at wit.
 Goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is 
in respect to his name, 
 which he feels that he fills even as he fills 
his skin;
 Herder having written the following lines on his 
name: — 

Der du von Gottern abstammst, 
 von Gothen oder vom Kote.
 
So seid ihr Gotterbilder auch zu Staub.
 

Thou who art bom of the gods, 
 of the Goths, 
 or of the mud.
 
Thus are thy godlike images even dust.
 

I realize that this digression on the misuse of names was intended 
merely to justify this complaint.
 But here let us stop.
 .
 .
 .
 The 
purchase at Spalato reminds me of another purchase at Cattaro, 
 
where I was too cautious, 
 and missed the opportunity of making 
an excellent bargain.
 (Missing an opportunity at the breast of 
the wet-nurse;
 see above.
) One of the dream-thoughts occasioned by the sensation of hunger really amounts to this: We 
should let nothing escape;
 we should take what we can get, 
 even 
if we do a little wrong;
 we should never let an opportunity go 
by;
 life is so short, 
 and death inevitable.
 Because this is meant 
even sexually, 
 and because desire is unwilling to check itself 
before the thought of doing wrong, 
 this philosophy of carpe diem 
has reason to fear the censorship, 
 and must conceal itself behind 
a dream.
 And so all sorts of counter-thoughts find expression, 
 
with recollections of the time when spiritual nourishment alone 
was sufficient for the dreamer, 
 with hindrances of every kind 
and even threats of disgusting sexual punishments.
 

II.
 A second dream requires a longer preliminary statement: 

I had driven to the Western Station in order to start on a 
holiday trip to the Aussee, 
 but I went on to the platform in time 
for the Ischl train, 
 which leaves earlier.
 There I saw Count Thun, 
 
who was again going to see the Emperor at Ischl.
 In spite of the 
rain he arrived in an open carriage, 
 caiue straight through the 
entrance-gate for the local trains, 
 and with a curt gesture and 
not a word of explanation he waved back the gatekeeper, 
 who 
did not know him and wanted to take his ticket.
 After he had 
left in the Ischl train, 
 I was asked to leave the platform and 
return to the waiting-room;
 but after some difficulty I obtained 
permission to remain.
 I passed the time noting how many people 
bribed the officials to secure a compartment;
 I fully intended 
to make a complaint — that is, 
 to demand the same privilege.
 
Meanwhile I sang something to myself, 
 which I afterwards recognized as the aria from The Marriage of Figaro : — 

If my lord Count would tread a measure, 
 tread a measure, 
 
Let him but say his pleasure, 
 

And I will play the tune.
 

(Possibly another person would not have recognized the tune.
) 

The whole evening I was in a high-spirited, 
 pugnacious mood ;
 
I chaffed the waiter and the cab-driver, 
 I hope without hurting 
their feelings;
 and now all kinds of bold and revolutionary 
thought came into my mind, 
 such as would fit themselves to the 
words of Figaro, 
 and to memories of Beaumarchais’ comedy, 
 of 
which I had seen a performance at the CombAie Frangaise.
 The 
speech about the great men who have taken the trouble to be 
born;
 the seigneurial right which Count Almaviva wishes to 
exercise with regard to Susanne;
 the jokes which our malicious 
Opposition journalists make on the name of Count Thun (German, 
 thun = do) ;
 calling him Graf Nichtsthun, 
 Count-DoNothing.
 I really do not envy him;
 he now has a difficult audience with the Emperor before him, 
 and it is I who am the real 
Count-Do-Nothing, 
 for I am going off for a holiday.
 I make all 
sorts of amusing plans for the vacation.
 Now a gentleman arrives whom I know as a Government representative at the medical examinations, 
 and who has won the flattering nickname of 
the Governmental bedfellow (literally, 
 by-sleeper) by his 
activities in this capacity.
 By insisting on his official status he 
secured half a first-class compartment, 
 and I heard one guard 
say to another: Where are we going to put the gentleman with 
the first-class half-compartment? A pretty sort of favouritism! 
I am paying for a whole first-class compartment.
 I did actually 
get a whole compartment to myself, 
 but not in a through carriage, 
 so there was no lavatory at my disposal during the night.
 
My complaints to the guard were fruitless;
 I revenged myself 
by suggesting that at least a hole be made in the floor of this 
compartment, 
 to serve the possible needs of passengers.
 At a 
quarter to three in the morning I wake, 
 with an urgent desire to 
urinate, 
 from the following dream: — 

A crowd, 
 a students' meeting , 
 .
 .
 , 
 A certain Count (Thun or 
Taaffe) is making a speech .
 Being asked to say something about 
the Germans, 
 he declares, 
 with a contemptuous gesture, 
 that 
their favourite flower is coltsfoot , 
 and he then puts into his buttonhole something like a torn leaf, 
 really the crumpled skelton 
of a leaf .
 I jump up, 
 and I jump up, 
 2 * but I am surprised at my 
implied attitude .
 Then, 
 more indistinctly: It seems as though 
this were the vestibule (Aula);
 the exits are thronged, 
 and one 
must escape .
 I make my way through a suite of handsomely 
appointed rooms , 
 evidently ministerial apartments, 
 with furniture of a colour between brown and violet, 
 and at last I come to 
a corridor in which a housekeeper, 
 a fat, 
 elderly woman, 
 is 
seated .
 I try to avoid speaking to her, 
 but she apparently thinks 
I have a right to pass this way, 
 because she asks whether she 
shall accompany me with the lamp.
 I indicate with a gesture, 
 or 
tell her, 
 that she is to remain standing on the stairs, 
 and it seems 
to me that I am very clever, 
 for after all I am evading detection.
 
Now I am downstairs, 
 and I find a narrow , 
 steeply rising path, 
 
which I follow.
 

Again indistinctly: It is as though my second task ^cro to get 
away from the city, 
 just a: my first was to get out of the building .
 I am riding in a one-horse cab, 
 and I tell the driver to take 
me to a railway station .
 I can’t drive with you on the railway 
line itself  I say, 
 when he reproaches me as though I had tired 
him out .
 Here it seems as though I had already made a journey 
in his cab which is usually made by rail The stations are 
crowded;
 I am wondering whether to go to Krcms or to Znaim, 
 
but 1 reflect that the Court will be there, 
 and I decide in favour 
of Graz or some such place.
 Now I am seated in the railway carriage , 
 which is rather like a tram, 
 and I have in my buttonhole 
a peculiar long braided thing, 
 on which are violet-brown violets 
of stiff material, 
 which makes a great impression on people .
 Here 
the scene breaks off.
 

I am once more in front of the railway station, 
 but I am in 
the company of an elderly gentleman .
 I think out a scheme for 
remaining unrecognized, 
 but I see this plan already being carried 
out.
 Thinking and experiencing are here, 
 as it were, 
 the same 
thing .
 He pretends to be blind, 
 at least in one eye, 
 and I hold 
before him a male glass urinal ( which we have to buy in the city , 
 
or have bought ).
 I am thus a sick-nurse, 
 and have to give him 
the urinal because he is blind * If the conductor secs us in this 
position, 
 he must pass us by without drawing attention to us.
 At 
the same time the position of the elderly man, 
 and his urinating 
organ, 
 is plastically perceived .
 Then I wake with a desire to 
urinate .
 

The whole dream seems a sort of phantasy, 
 which takes the 
dreamer back to the year of revolution, 
 1848, 
 the memory of 
which had been revived by the jubilee of 1898, 
 as well as by a 
little excursion to Wachau, 
 on which I visited Emmersdorf, 
 the 
refuge of the student leader Fischof, 
 26 to whom several features 
of the manifest dream-content might refer.
 The association of 
ideas then leads me to England, 
 to the house of my brother, 
 
who used in jest to twit his wife with the title of Tennyson’s 
poem Fifty Years Ago, 
 whereupon the children were used to 
correct him: Fifteen Years Ago.
 This phantasy, 
 however, 
 which 
attaches itself to the thoughts evoked by the sight of Count 
Thun, 
 is, 
 like the facade of an Italian church, 
 without organic 
connection with the structure behind it, 
 but unlike such a facade 
it is full of gaps, 
 and confused, 
 and in many places portions of 
the interior break through.
 The first situation of the dream is 
made up of a number of scenes, 
 into which I am able to dissect 
it.
 The arrogant attitude of the Count in the dream is copied 
from a scene at my school which occurred in my fifteenth year.
 
We had hatched a conspiracy against an unpopular and ignorant 
teacher;
 the leading spirit in this conspiracy was a schoolmate 
who since that time seems to have taken Henry VIII of England 
as his model.
 It fell to me to carry out the coup d’itat, 
 and a 
discussion of the importance of the Danube (German, 
 Donau) 
to Austria (Wachau!) was the occasion of an open revolt.
 One 
of our fellow-conspirators was our only aristocratic schoolmate 
— he was called the giraffe on account of his conspicuous 
height — and while he was being reprimanded by the tyrant of 
the school, 
 the professor of the German language, 
 he stood just 
as the Count stood in the dream.
 The explanation of the favourite 
flower, 
 and the putting into a buttonhole of something that 
must have been a flower (which recalls the orchids which I had 
given that day to a friend, 
 and also a rose of Jericho) prominently recalls the incident in Shakespeare’s historical play which 
opens the civil wars of the Red and the White Roses;
 the mention of Henry VIII has paved the way to this reminiscence.
 Now 
it is not very far from roses to red and white carnations.
 (Meanwhile two little rhymes, 
 the one German, 
 the other Spanish, 
 
insinuate themselves into the analysis: Rosen, 
 Tulpen, 
 Nelken, 
 
alle Blumen welken, 
 and Isabelita, 
 no llores, 
 que se marchitan 
las flores.
 The Spanish line occurs in Figaro.
) Here in Vienna 
white carnations have become the badge of the Anti-Semites, 
 
red ones of the Social Democrats.
 Behind this is the recollection 
of an anti-Semitic challenge during a railway journey in beautiful Saxony (Anglo-Saxon).
 The third scene contributing to 
the formation of the first situation in the dream dates from my 
early student days.
 There was a debate in a German students’ 
dub about the relation of philosophy to the general sciences.
 

Being a green youth, 
 full of materialistic doctrines, 
 I thrust myself forward in order to defend an extremely one-sided position.
 
Thereupon a sagacious older fellow-student, 
 who has since then 
shown his capacity for leading men and organizing the masses, 
 
and who, 
 moreover, 
 bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom, 
 rose and gave us a thorough dressing-down;
 he too, 
 he 
said, 
 had herded swine in his youth, 
 and had then returned 
repentant to his father’s house.
 I jumped up (as in the dream), 
 
became piggishly rude, 
 and retorted that since I knew he had 
herded swine, 
 I was not surprised at the tone of his discourse.
 
(In the dream I am surprised at my German Nationalistic feelings.
) There was a great commotion, 
 and an almost general 
demand that I should retract my words, 
 but I stood my ground.
 
The insulted student was too sensible to take the advice which 
was offered him, 
 that he should send me a challenge, 
 and let the 
matter drop.
 

The remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more 
remote origin.
 What does it mean that the Count should make 
a scornful reference to coltsfoot? Here I must question my train 
of associations.
 Coltsfoot (German: Huflattich), 
 Lattice (lettuce) , 
 Salathund (the dog that grudges others what he cannot 
eat himself).
 Here plenty of approbrious epithets may be discerned: Gir-affe (German: Affe = monkey, 
 ape) , 
 pig, 
 sow, 
 dog;
 
I might even arrive, 
 by way of the name, 
 at donkey, 
 and thereby 
pour contempt upon an academic professor.
 Furthermore, 
 I 
translate coltsfoot (Huflattich) — I do not know whether I do 
so correctly — by pisse-en-lit.
 I get this idea from Zola’s Germinal, 
 in which some children are told to bring some dandelion 
salad with them.
 The dog — ckien — has a name sounding not 
unlike the verb for the major function (chier, 
 as pisser stands for 
the minor one).
 Now we shall soon have the indecent in all its 
three physical categories, 
 for in the same Germinal, 
 which deals 
with the future revolution, 
 there is a description of a very 
peculiar contest, 
 which relates to the production of the gaseous 
excretions known as flatus .
 27 And now I cannot but observe how 
the way to this flatus has been prepared a long while since, 
 beginning with the flowers, 
 and proceeding to the Spanish rhyme 
of Isabelita, 
 to Ferdinand and Isabella, 
 and, 
 by way of Henry 
VIII, 
 to English history at the time of the Armada, 
 after the 
victorious termination of which the English struck a medal with 
the inscription: Flavit et dissipati sunt, 
 for the storm had scattered the Spanish fleet.
 28 1 had thought of using this phrase, 
 half 
jestingly, 
 as the title of a chapter on Therapy, 
 if I should 
ever succeed in giving a detailed account of my conception and 
treatment of hysteria.
 

I cannot give so detailed an interpretation of the second scene 
of the dream, 
 out of sheer regard for the censorship.
 For at this 
point I put myself in the place of a certain eminent gentleman 
of the revolutionary period, 
 who had an adventure with an eagle 
(German: Adler) and who is said to have suffered from incontinence of the bowels, 
 incontinentia aim, 
 etc.
;
 and here I believe 
that I should not be justified in passing the censorship, 
 even 
though it was an aulic councillor (aula, 
 consiliarius aulicus) 
who told me the greater part of this history.
 The suit of rooms 
in the dream is suggested by his Excellency’s private saloon carriage, 
 into which I was able to glance;
 but it means, 
 as it so 
often does in dreams, 
 a woman (Frauenzimmer, 
 German, 
 Zimmer — room, 
 is appended to Frauen — woman, 
 in order to imply 
a slight contempt 20 ).
 The personality of the housekeeper is an 
ungrateful allusion to a witty old lady, 
 which ill repays her for 
the good times and the many good stories which I have enjoyed 
in her house.
 The incident of the lamp goes back to Grillparzer, 
 
who notes a cha rmi ng experience of a similar nature, 
 of which he 
afterwards made use in Eero and Leander (the waves of the sea 
and of love — the Armada and the storm ) .
 

I must forego a detailed analysis of the two remaining portions of the dream;
 I shall single out only those elements which 
lead me back to the two scenes of my childhood for the sake of 
which alone I have selected the dream.
 The reader will rightly 
assume that it is sexual material which necessitates the suppression;
 but he may not be content with this explanation.
 There 
are many things of which one makes no secret to oneself, 
 but 
which must be treated as secrets in addressing others, 
 and here 
we are concerned not with the reasons which induce me to conceal the solution, 
 but with the motive of the inner censorship 
which conceals the real content of the dream even from myself.
 
Concerning this, 
 I will confess that the analysis reveals these 
three portions of the dream as impertinent boasting, 
 the exuberance of an absurd megalomania, 
 long ago suppressed in my waking life, 
 which, 
 however, 
 dares to show itself, 
 with individual 
ramifications, 
 even in the manifest dream-content (it seem to 
me that 1 am a cunning fellow) , 
 making the high-spirited mood 
of the evening before the dream perfectly intelligible.
 Boasting 
of every kind, 
 indeed;
 thus, 
 the mention of Graz points to the 
phrase: What price Graz? which one is wont to use when one 
feels unusually wealthy.
 Readers who recall Master Rabelais’s 
inimitable description of the life and deeds of Gargantua and 
his son Pantagruel will be able to enroll even the suggested content of the first portion of the dream among the boasts to which 
I have alluded.
 But the following belongs to the two scenes of 
childhood of which I have spoken: I had bought a new trunk 
for this journey, 
 the colour of which, 
 a brownish violet , 
 appears 
in the dream several times (violet-brown violets of a stiff cloth, 
 
on an object which is known as a girl-catcher — the furniture 
in the ministerial chambers).
 Children, 
 we know, 
 believe that 
one attracts people’s attention with anything new.
 Now I have 
been told of the following incident of my childhood;
 my recollection of the occurrence itself has been replaced by my recollection of the story.
 I am told that at the age of two I still used 
occasionally to wet my bed, 
 and that when I was reproved for 
doing so I consoled my father by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in N.
 (the nearest large town).
 Hence, 
 the 
interpolation in the dream, 
 that we had bought the urinal in the 
city or had to buy it;
 one must keep one’s promises.
 (One should 
note, 
 moreover, 
 the association of the male urinal and the 
woman’s trunk, 
 box.
) All the megalomania of the child is contained in this promise.
 The significance of dreams of urinary 
difficulties in the case of children has already been considered in 
the interpretation of an earlier dream (cf .
 the dream on p.
 73 ff.
) .
 
The psychoanalysis of neurotics has taught us to recog niz e the 
intimate connection between wetting the bed and the character 
trait of ambition.
 

Then, 
 when I was seven or eight years of age another domestic 
incident occurred which I remember very well.
 One evening, 
 before going to bed, 
 I had disregarded the dictates of discretion, 
 
and had satisfied my needs in my parents’ bedroom, 
 and in their 
presence.
 Reprimanding me for this delinquency, 
 my father remarked: That boy will never amount to anything.
 This must 
have been a terrible affront to my ambition, 
 for allusions to this 
scene recur again and again in my dreams, 
 and are constantly 
coupled with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes, 
 as though I wanted to say: You see, 
 I have amounted to 
something after all.
 This childish scene furnishes the elements 
for the last image of the dream, 
 in which the roles are interchanged, 
 of course for the purpose of revenge.
 The elderly man, 
 
obviously my father, 
 for the blindness in one eye signifies his 
one-sided glaucoma, 
 80 is now urinating before me as I once urinated before him.
 By means of the glaucoma I remind my father 
of cocaine, 
 which stood him in good stead during his operation, 
 
as though I had thereby fulfilled my promise.
 Besides, 
 I make 
sport of him;
 since he is blind, 
 I must hold the glass in front of 
him, 
 and I delight in allusions to my knowledge of the theory of 
hysteria, 
 of which I am proud.
 

Here is some more material for interpretation;
 Holding the urine-glass 
recalls the story of a peasant (illiterate) at the optician’s, 
 who tried on now 
one pair of spectacles, 
 now another, 
 but was still unable to read.
 — (Peasantcatcher — girl-catcher in the preceding portion of the dream.
) — The peasants’ treatment of the feeble-minded father in Zola’s La Terre.
— The tragic 
atonement, 
 that in his last days my father soiled his bed like a child;
 hence, 
 
I am his nurse in the dream.
 — Thinking and experiencing are here, 
 as it 
were, 
 identical  ;
 this recalls a highly revolutionary closet drama by Oscar 

nS 

If the two childish scenes of urination are, 
 according to my 
theory, 
 closely associated with the desire for greatness, 
 their 
resuscitation on the journey to the Aussee was further favoured 
by the accidental circumstance that my compartment had no 
lavatory, 
 and that I must be prepared to postpone relief during 
the journey, 
 as actually happened in the morning when I woke 
with the sensation of a bodily need* I suppose one might be inclined to credit this sensation with being the actual stimulus of 
the clream;
 I should, 
 however, 
 prefer a different explanation, 
 
namely, 
 that the dream-thoughts first gave rise to the desire to 
urinate.
 It is quite unusual for me to be disturbed in sleep by any 

Panizza, 
 in which God, 
 the Father, 
 is ignominously treated as a palsied 
greybeard.
 With Him will and deed are one, 
 and in the book he has to be 
restrained by His archangel, 
 a sort of Ganymede, 
 from scolding and swearing, 
 because His curses would immediately be fulfilled.
— Making plans is a 
reproach against my father, 
 dating from a later period in the development 
of the critical faculty, 
 much as the whole rebellious content of the dream, 
 
which commits Use majesU and scorns authority, 
 may be traced to a revolt 
against my father.
 The sovereign is called the father of his country 
(Landesvatcr ) , 
 and the father is the first and oldest, 
 and for the child the 
only authority, 
 from whose absolutism the other social authorities have 
evolved in the course of the history of human civilization (in so far as 
mother-right does not necessitate a qualification of this doctrine).
 — 
The words which occurred to me in the dream, 
 thinking and experiencing 
are the same thing, 
 refer to the explanation of hysterical symptoms, 
 with 
which the male urinal (glass) is also associated.
 — I need not explain the 
principle of Gschnas to a Viennese;
 it consists in constructing objects of 
rare and costly appearance out of trivial, 
 and preferably comical and worthless material— for example, 
 making suits of armour out of kitchen utensils, 
 
wisps of straw and Scdzstangeln (long rolls) , 
 as our artists arc fond of doing 
at their jolly parties.
 I had learned that hysterical subjects do the same 
thing;
 besides what really happens to them, 
 they unconsciously conceive 
for themselves horrible or extravagantly fantastic incidents, 
 which they 
build up out of the most harmless and commonplace material of actual experience.
 The symptoms attach themselves primarily to these phantasies, 
 
not to the memory of real events, 
 whether serious or trivial.
 This explanation had helped me to overcome many difficulties, 
 and afforded me much 
pleasure.
 I was able to allude to it by means of the dream-element male 
urine-glass, 
 because I had been told that at the last Gschnas evening a 
poison-chalice of Lucretia Borgia’s had been exhibited, 
 the chief constituent of which had consisted of a glass urinal for men, 
 such as is used in 
hospitals.
 

physical need, 
 least of all at the time when I woke on this occasion — a quarter to three in the morning.
 I would forestall a 
further objection by remarking that I have hardly ever felt a 
desire to urinate after waking early on other journeys made 
under more comfortable circumstances.
 However, 
 I can leave 
this point undecided without weakening my argument.
 

Further, 
 since experience in dream-analysis has drawn my 
attention to the fact that even from dreams the interpretation of 
which seems at first sight complete, 
 because the dream-sources 
and the wish-stimuli are easily demonstrable, 
 important trains 
of thought proceed which reach back into the earliest years of 
childhood, 
 I had to ask myself whether this characteristic does 
not even constitute an essential condition of dreaming.
 If it were 
permissible to generalize this notion, 
 I should say that every 
dream is connected through its manifest content with recent experiences, 
 while through its latent content it is connected with 
the most remote experiences;
 and I can actually show in the 
analysis of hysteria that these remote experiences have in a very 
real sense remained recent right up to the present.
 But I still find 
it very difficult to prove this conjecture;
 I shall have to return 
to the probable r 61 e in dream-formation of the earliest experiences of our childhood in another connection (Chapter VII).
 

Of the three peculiarities of the dream-memory considered 
above, 
 one — the preference for the unimportant in the dreamcontent — has been satisfactorily explained by tracing it back to 
dream-distortion.
 We have succeeded in establishing the existence of the other two peculiarities — the preferential selection of 
recent and also of infantile material — but we have found it impossible to derive them from the motives of the dream.
 Let us 
keep in mind these two characteristics, 
 which we still have to 
explain or evaluate;
 a place will have to be found for them elsewhere, 
 either in the discussion of the psychology of the sleeping 
state, 
 or in the consideration of the structure of the psychic 
apparatus— which we shall undertake later after we have seen 
that by means of dream-interpretation we are able to glance as 
through an inspection-hole into the interior of this apparatus.
 

But here and now I will emphasize another result of the last 
few dream-analyses.
 The dream often appears to have several 
meanings;
 not only may several wish-fulfilments be combined 
in it, 
 as our examples show, 
 but one meaning or one wish-fulfilment may conceal another, 
 until in the lowest stratum one comes 
upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period of childhood;
 and here again it may be questioned whether the word 
often at the beginning of this sentence may not more correctly 
be replaced by constantly .

C.
 THE SOMATIC SOURCES OF DREAMS 

If we attempt to interest a cultured layman in the problems of 
dreams, 
 and if, 
 with this end in view, 
 we ask him what he believes 
to be the source of dreams, 
 we shall generally find that he feels 
quite sure he knows at least this part of the solution.
 He thinks 
immediately of the influence exercised on the formation of 
dreams by a disturbed or impeded digestion (Dreams come 
from the stomach), 
 an accidental position of the body, 
 a trifling 
occurrence during sleep.
 He does not seem to suspect that even 
after all these factors have been duly considered something still 
remains to be explained.
 

In the introductory chapter 33 we examined at length the 
opinion of scientific writers on the role of somatic stimuli in the 
formation of dreams, 
 so that here we need only recall the results 
of this inquiry.
 We have seen that three kinds of somatic stimuli 
will be distinguished: the objective sensory stimuli which proceed from external objects, 
 the inner states of excitation of the 
sensory organs, 
 having only a subjective reality, 
 and the bodily 
stimuli arising within the body;
 and we have also noticed that 
the writers on dreams are inclined to thrust into the background 
any psychic sources of dreams which may operate simultaneously 
with the somatic stimuli, 
 or to exclude them altogether.
 In testing 
the claims made on behalf of these somatic stimuli we have learned 
that the significance of the objective excitation of the sensory 
organs — whether accidental stimuli operating during sleep, 
 or 
such as cannot be excluded from the dormant relation of these 
dream-images and ideas to the internal bodily stimuli and confirmed by experiment;
 that the part played by the subjective 
sensory stimuli appears to be demonstrated by the recurrence of 
hypnagogic sensory images in dreams;
 and that, 
 although the 
broadly accepted relation of these dream-images and ideas to 
the internal bodily stimuli cannot be exhaustively demonstrated, 
 
it is at all events confirmed by the well-known influence which 
an excited state of the digestive, 
 urinary and sexual organs exercises upon the content of our dreams.
 

Nerve stimulus and bodily stimulus would thus be the 
anatomical sources of dreams;
 that is, 
 according to many writers, 
 
the sole and exclusive sources of dreams.
 

But we have already considered a number of doubtful points, 
 
which seem to question not so much the correctness of the 
somatic theory as its adequacy.
 

However confident the representatives of this theory may be 
of its factual basis — especially in respect of the accidental and 
external nerve-stimuli, 
 which may without difficulty be recognized in the dream-content — nevertheless they have all come 
near to admitting that the rich content of ideas found in dreams 
cannot be derived from the external nerve-stimuli alone.
 In this 
connection Miss Mary Whiton Calkins tested her own dreams, 
 
and those of a second person, 
 for a period of six weeks, 
 and found 
that the element of external sensory perception was demonstrable in only 13.
2 per cent, 
 and 6.
7 per cent, 
 of these dreams 
respectively.
 Only two dreams in the whole collection could be 
referred to organic sensations.
 These statistics confirm what a 
cursory survey of our own experience would already have led us 
to suspect.
 

A distinction has often been made between nerve-stimulus 
dreams which have already been thoroughly investigated, 
 and 
other forms of dreams.
 Spitta, 
 for example, 
 divided dreams into 
nerve-stimulus dreams and association-dreams.
 But it was obvious that this solution remained unsatisfactory unless the link 
between the somatic sources of dreams and their ideational content could be indicated.
 

In addition to the first objection, 
 that of the insufficient frequency of the extern;
i] sources of stimulus, 
 a second objection 
presents itself, 
 namely, 
 the inadequacy of the explanations of 
dreams afforded by this category of dream-sources.
 There are 
two things which the representatives of this theory have failed 
to explain: firstly, 
 why the true nature of the external stimulus 
is not recognized in die dream, 
 but is constantly mistaken for 
something else;
 and secondly, 
 why the result of the reaction of 
the perceiving mind to this misconceived stimulus should be so 
indeterminate and variable.
 We have seen that Striimpell, 
 in 
answer to these questions, 
 asserts that the mind, 
 since it turns 
away from the outer world during sleep, 
 is not in a position to 
give the correct interpretation of the objective sensory stimulus, 
 
but is forced to construct illusions on the basis of the indefinite 
stimulation arriving from many directions.
 In his own words 
(Die Natur md Entstchmg dcr Traume, 
 p.
 108) : 

When by an external or internal nerve-stimulus during sleep 
a feeling, 
 or a complex of feelings, 
 or any sort of psychic process 
arises in the mind, 
 and is perceived by the mind, 
 this process 
calls up from the mind perceptual images belonging to the 
sphere of the waking experiences, 
 that is to say, 
 earlier perceptions, 
 either unembellished, 
 or with the psychic values appertaining to them.
 It collects about itself, 
 as it were, 
 a greater or 
lesser number of such images, 
 from which the impression resulting from the nerve-stimulus receives its psychic value.
 In this 
connection it is commonly said, 
 as in ordinary language we say 
of the waking procedure, 
 that the mind interprets in sleep the 
impressions of nervous stimuli.
 The result of this interpretation 
is the so-called nerve-stimulus dream — that is, 
 a dream the components of which are conditioned by the fact that a nerve-stimulus 
produces its psychical effect in the life of the mind in accordance with the laws of reproduction.
 

In all essential points identical with this doctrine is Wundt’s 
statement that the concepts of dreams proceed, 
 at all events for 
the most part, 
 from sensory stimuli, 
 and especially from the 
stimuli of general sensation, 
 and are therefore mostly phantastic 
illusions — probably only to a small extent pure memory -conceptions raised to the condition of hallucinations.
 To illustrate the 
relation between dream-content and dream-stimuli which follows 
from this theory, 
 Striimpell makes use of an excellent simile.
 It 
is as though the ten fingers of a person ignorant of music were 
to stray over the keyboard of an instrument.
 The implication is 
that the dream is not a psychic phenomenon, 
 originating from 
psychic motives, 
 but the result of a physiological stimulus, 
 
which expresses itself in psychic symptomatology because the 
apparatus affected by the stimulus is not capable of any other 
mode of expression.
 Upon a similar assumption is based the explanation of obsessions which Meynert attempted in his famous 
simile of the dial on which individual figures are most deeply 
embossed.
 

Popular though this theory of the somatic dream-stimuli has 
become, 
 and seductive though it may seem, 
 it is none the less 
easy to detect its weak point.
 Every somatic dream-stimulus 
which provokes the psychic apparatus in sleep to interpretation 
by the formation of illusions may evoke an incalculable number 
of such attempts at interpretation.
 It may consequently be represented in the dream-content by an extraordinary number of 
different concepts .
 34 But the theory of Striimpell and Wundt cannot point to any sort of motive which controls the relation between the external stimulus and the dream-concept chosen to 
interpret it, 
 and therefore it cannot explain the peculiar choice 
which the stimuli often enough make in the course of their 
productive activity (Lipps, 
 Grundtatsachen des Seelenlebens x 
p.
 170).
 Other objections may be raised against the fundamental 
assumption behind the theory of illusions — the assumption that 
during sleep the mind is not in a condition to recognize the real 
nature of the objective sensory stimuli.
 The old physiologist 
Burdach shows us that the mind is quite capable even during 
sleep of a correct interpretation of the sensory impressions which 
reach it, 
 and of reacting in accordance with this correct interpretation, 
 inasmuch as he demonstrates that certain sensory impressions which seem important to the individual may be excepted from the general neglect of the sleeping mind (as in 
the example of nurse and child), 
 and that one is more surely 
awakened by one’s own name than by an indifferent auditory 
impression;
 all of which presupposes, 
 of course, 
 that the mind 
discriminates between sensations, 
 even in sleep.
 Burdach infers 
from these observations that we must not assume that the mind 
is incapable of interpreting sensory stimuli in the sleeping state, 
 
but rather that it is not sufficiently interested in them.
 The arguments which Burdach employed in 1830 reappear unchanged in 
the works of Lipps (in the year 1883), 
 where they are employed 
for the purpose of attacking the theory of somatic stimuli.
 According to these arguments the mind seems to be like the sleeper 
in the anecdote, 
 who, 
 on being asked, 
 Are you asleep? answers 
No, 
 and on being again addressed with the words: Then lend 
me ten florins, 
 takes refuge in the excuse: I am asleep.
 

The inadequacy of the theory of somatic dream-stimuli may 
be further demonstrated in another way.
 Observation shows that 
external stimuli do not oblige me to dream, 
 even though these 
stimuli appear in the dream-content as soon as I begin to dream 
— supposing that I do dream.
 In response to a touch- or pressurestimulus experienced while I am asleep, 
 a variety of reactions 
are at my disposal.
 I may overlook it, 
 and find on waking that 
my leg has become uncovered, 
 or that I have been lying on an 
arm;
 indeed, 
 pathology offers me a host of examples of powerfully exciting sensory and motor stimuli of different kinds which 
remain ineffective during sleep, 
 I may perceive the sensation 
during sleep, 
 and through my sleep, 
 as it were, 
 as constantly 
happens in the case of pain stimuli, 
 but without weaving the pain 
into the texture of a dream.
 And thirdly, 
 I may wake up in 
response to the stimulus, 
 simply in order to avoid it.
 Still another, 
 
fourth, 
 reaction is possible: namely, 
 that the nerve-stimulus 
may cause me to dream;
 but the other possible reactions occur 
quite as frequently as the reaction of dream-formation.
 This, 
 
however, 
 would not be the case if the incentive to dreaming did 
not lie outside the somatic dream-sources.
 

Appreciating the importance of the above-mentioned lacunae 
in the explanation of dreams by somatic stimuli, 
 other writers — 
Schemer, 
 for example, 
 and, 
 following him, 
 the philosopher Volkelt — endeavoured to determine more precisely the nature of 
the psychic activities which cause the many-coloured images of 
our dreams to proceed from the somatic stimuli, 
 and in so doing 
they approached the problem of the essential nature of dreams 
as a problem of psychology, 
 and regarded dreaming as a psychic 
activity.
 Schemer not only gave a poetical, 
 vivid and glowing 
description of the psychic peculiarities which unfold themselves 
in the course of dream-formation, 
 but he also believed that he 
had hit upon the principle of the method the mind employs in 
dealing with the stimuli which are offered to it.
 The dream, 
 according to Schemer, 
 in the free activity of the phantasy, 
 which 
has been released from the shackles imposed upon it during the 
day, 
 strives to represent symbolically the nature of the organ 
from which the stimulus proceeds.
 Thus there exists a sort of 
dream-book, 
 a guide to the interpretation of dreams, 
 by means 
of which bodily sensations, 
 the conditions of the organs, 
 and 
states of stimulation, 
 may be inferred from the dream-images.
 
Thus the image of a cat expressed extreme ill-temper, 
 the 
image of pale, 
 smooth pastry the nudity of the body.
 The human 
body as a whole is pictured by the phantasy of the dream as a 
house, 
 and the individual organs of the body as parts of the 
house.
 In ‘toothache-dreams’ a vaulted vestibule corresponds to 
the mouth, 
 and a staircase to the descent from the pharynx to 
the oesophagus;
 in the ‘headache-dream’ a ceiling covered with 
disgusting toad-like spiders is chosen to denote the upper part 
of the head.
 Many different symbols are employed by our 
dreams for the same organ: thus the breathing lung finds its 
symbol in a roaring stove, 
 filled with flames, 
 the heart in empty 
boxes and baskets, 
 and the bladder in round, 
 bag-shaped or 
merely hollow objects.
 It is of particular significance that at the 
dose of the dream the stimulating organ or its function is often 
represented without disguise, 
 and usually on the dreamer’s own 
body.
 Thus the ‘toothache-dream’ commonly ends by the dreamer 
drawing a tooth out of his mouth.
 It cannot be said that 
this theory of dream-interpretation has found much favour with 
other writers.
 It seems, 
 above all, 
 extravagant;
 and so Schemer’s 
readers have hesistated to give it even the small amount of credit 
to which it is, 
 in my opinion, 
 entitled.
 As will be seen, 
 it tends to 
a revival of dream-interpretation by means of symbolism, 
 a 
method employed by the ancients;
 only the province from which 
the interpretation is to be derived is restricted to the human 
body.
 The lack of a scientifically comprehensible technique of 
interpretation must seriously limit the applicability of Schemer’s 
theory.
 Arbitrariness in the interpretation of dreams would appear to be by no means excluded, 
 especially since in this case 
also a stimulus may be expressed in the dream-contcnt by several 
representative symbols;
 thus even Schemer’s follower Volkelt 
was unable to confirm the representation of the body as a house.
 
Another objection is that here again the dream-activity is regarded as a useless and aimless activity of the mind, 
 since, 
 according to this theory, 
 the mind is content with merely forming 
phantasies around the stimulus with which it is dealing, 
 without 
even remotely attempting to abolish the stimulus.
 

Schemer’s theory of the symbolization of bodily stimuli by 
the dream is seriously damaged by yet another objection.
 These 
bodily stimuli are present at all times, 
 and it is generally assumed 
that the mind is more accessible to them during sleep than in the 
waking state.
 It is therefore impossible to understand why the 
mind does not dream continuously all night long, 
 and why it does 
not dream every night about all the organs.
 If one attempts to 
evade this objection by positing the condition that special excitations must proceed from the eye, 
 the ear, 
 the teeth, 
 the bowels, 
 
etc.
, 
 in order to arouse the dream-activity, 
 one is confronted 
with the difficulty of proving that this increase of stimulation is 
objective;
 and proof is possible only in a very few cases.
 If the 
dream of flying is a symbolization of the upward and downward 
motion of the pulmonary lobes, 
 either this dream, 
 as has already 
been remarked by Striimpell, 
 should be dreamt much oftener, 
 
or it should be possible to show that respiration is more active 
during this dream.
 Yet a third alternative is possible — and it is 
the most probable of all — namely, 
 that now and again special 
motives are operative to direct the attention to the visceral sensations which are constantly present.
 But this would take us 
far beyond the scope of Schemer’s theory.
 

The value of Schemer’s and Volkelt’s disquisitions resides in 
their calling our attention to a number of characteristics of the 
dream-content which are in need of explanation, 
 and which seem 
to promise fresh discoveries.
 It is quite true that symbolizations 
of the bodily organs and functions do occur in dreams: for example, 
 that water in a dream often signifies a desire to urinate, 
 
that the male genital organ may be represented by an upright 
staff, 
 or a pillar, 
 etc.
 With dreams which exhibit a very animated 
field of vision and brilliant colours, 
 in contrast to the dimness of 
other dreams, 
 the interpretation that they are dreams due to 
visual stimulation can hardly be dismissed, 
 nor can we dispute 
the participation of illusion-formation in dreams which contain 
noise and a medley of voices.
 A dream like that of Schemer’s, 
 
that two rows of fair handsome boys stood facing one another 
on a bridge, 
 attacking one another, 
 and then resuming their positions, 
 until finally the dreamer himself sat down on a bridge and 
drew a long tooth from his jaw;
 or a similar dream of Volkelt’s, 
 
in which two rows of drawers played a part, 
 and which again 
ended in the extraction of a tooth;
 dream-formations of this kind, 
 
of which both writers relate a great number, 
 forbid our dismissing Schemer’s theory as an idle invention without seeking the 
kernel of truth which may be contained in it.
 We are therefore 
confronted with the task of finding a different explanation of the 
supposed symbolization of the alleged dental stimulus.
 

Throughout our consideration of the theory of the somatic 
sources of dreams, 
 I have refrained from urging the argument 
which arises from our analyses of dreams.
 If by a procedure 
which has not been followed by other writers in their investigation of dreams we can prove that the dream possesses intrinsic 
value as psychic action, 
 that a wish supplies the motive of its 
formation, 
 and that the experiences of the previous day furnish 
the most obvious material of its content, 
 any other theory of 
dreams which neglects such an important method of investigation — and accordingly makes the dream appear a useless and 
enigmatical psychic reaction to somatic stimuli — may be dismissed without special criticism.
 For in this case there would 
have to be— and this is highly improbable — two entirely different 
kinds of dreams, 
 of which only one kind has come under our 
observation, 
 while the other kind alone has been observed by 
the earlier investigators.
 It only remains now to find a place in 
our theory of dreams for the facts on which the current doctrine 
of somatic dream-stimuli is based.
 

We have already taken the first step in this direction in advancing the thesis that the dream-work is under a compulsion to 
elaborate into a unified whole all the dream-stimuli which are 
simultaneously present (p.
 83).
 We have seen that when two 
or more experiences capable of making an impression on the 
mind have been left over from the previous day, 
 the wishes that 
result from them are united into one dream;
 similarly, 
 that the 
impressions possessing psychic value and the indifferent experiences of the previous day unite in the dream-material, 
 provided 
that connecting ideas between the two can be established.
 Thus 
the dream appears to be a reaction to everything which is simultaneously present as actual in the sleeping mind.
 As far as we 
have hitherto analysed the dream-material, 
 we have discovered 
it to be a collection of psychic remnants and memory-traces, 
 
which we were obliged to credit (on account of the preference 
shown for recent and for infantile material) with a character of 
psychological actuality, 
 though the nature of this actuality was 
not at the time determinable.
 We shall now have little difficulty 
in predicting what will happen when to these actualities of the 
memory fresh material in the form of sensations is added during 
sleep.
 These stimuli, 
 again, 
 are of importance to the dre am because they are actual;
 they are united with the other psychic 
actualities to provide the material for dream-formation.
 To 
express it in other words, 
 the stimuli which occur during sleep 
are elaborated into a wish-fulfilment, 
 of which the other components are the psychic remnants of daily experience with which 
we are already familiar.
 This combination, 
 however, 
 is not inevitable;
 
we have seen that more than one kind of behaviour 
toward the physical stimuli received during sleep is possible.
 
Where this combination is effected, 
 a conceptual material for 
the dream-content has been found which will represent both 
kinds of dream-sources, 
 the somatic as well as the psychic.
 

The nature of the dream is not altered when somatic material 
is added to the psychic dream-sources;
 it still remains a wishfulfilment, 
 no matter how its expression is determined by the 
actual material available.
 

I should like to find room here for a number of peculiarities 
which are able to modify the significance of external stimuli for 
the dream.
 I imagine that a co-operation of individual, 
 physiological and accidental factors, 
 which depend on the circumstances of the moment, 
 determines how one will behave in individual cases of more intensive objective stimulation during 
sleep;
 habitual or accidental profundity of sleep, 
 in conjunction 
with the intensity of the stimulus, 
 will in one case make it possible so to suppress the stimulus that it will not disturb the 
sleeper, 
 while in another case it will force the sleeper to wake, 
 
or will assist the attempt to subdue the stimulus by weaving it 
into the texture of the dream.
 In accordance with the multiplicity 
of these constellations, 
 external objective stimuli will be expressed more rarely or more frequently in the case of one person 
than in that of another.
 In my own case, 
 since I am an excellent 
sleeper, 
 and obstinately refuse to allow myself to be disturbed 
during sleep on any pretext whatever, 
 this intrusion of external 
causes of excitation into my dreams is very rare, 
 whereas psychic 
motives apparently cause me to dream very easily.
 Indeed, 
 I 
have noted only a single dream in which an objective, 
 painful 
source of stimulation is demonstrable, 
 and it will be highly instructive to see what effect the external stimulus had in this 
particular dream.
 

I am riding a gray horse , 
 at first timidly and awkwardly , 
 as 
though I were merely carried along.
 Then I meet a colleague, 
 P, 
, 
 
also on horseback , 
 and dressed in rough frieze ;
 he is sitting erect 
in the saddle;
 he calls my attention to something (probably to 
the fact that I have a very bad seat).
 Now I begin to feel more 
and more at ease on the back of my highly intelligent horse ;
 / 
sit more comfortably, 
 and I find that I am quite at home up 
here .
 My saddle is a sort of pad, 
 which completely fills the space 
between the neck and the rump of the horse.
 I ride between two 
vans, 
 and just manage to clear them.
 After riding up the street 
for some distance, 
 I turn round and wish to dismount, 
 at first in 
front of a little open chapel which is built facing onto the street.
 
Then Ido really dismount in front of a chapel which stands near 
the first one;
 the hotel is in the same street;
 I might let the horse 
go there by itself, 
 but I prefer to lead it thither.
 It seems as 
though I should be ashamed to arrive there on horseback.
 In 
front of the hotel there stands a page-boy, 
 who shows me a note 
of mine which has been found, 
 and ridicules me on account of it.
 
On the note is written, 
 doubly underlined, 
 Eat nothing  and 
then a second sentence (indistinct) : something like Do not 
work;
 at the same time a hazy idea that I am in a strange city, 
 
in which I do not work.
 

It will not at once be apparent that this dream originated 
under the influence, 
 or rather under the compulsion, 
 of a painstimulus.
 The day before, 
 however, 
 I had suffered from boils, 
 
which made every movement a torture, 
 and at last a boil had 
grown to the size of an apple at the root of the scrotum, 
 and 
had caused me the most intolerable pains at every step;
 a feverish lassitude, 
 lack of appetite, 
 and the hard work which I had 
nevertheless done during the day, 
 had conspired with the pain 
to upset me.
 I was not altogether in a condition to discharge my 
duties as a physician, 
 but in view of the nature and the location 
of the malady, 
 it was possible to imagine something else for 
which I was most of all unfit, 
 namely riding.
 Now it is this very 
activity of riding into which I am plunged by the dream;
 it is 
the most energetic denial of the pain which imagination could 
conceive.
 As a matter of fact, 
 I cannot ride;
 I do not dream of 
doing so;
 I never sat on a horse but once — and then without a 
saddle — and I did not like it.
 But in this dream I ride as though 
I had no boil on the perineum;
 or rather, 
 I ride, 
 just because I 
want to have none.
 To judge from the description, 
 my saddle is 
the poultice which has enabled me to fall asleep.
 Probably, 
 being 
thus comforted, 
 I did not feel anything of my pain during the 
first few hours of my sleep.
 Then the painful sensations made 
themselves felt, 
 and tried to wake me;
 whereupon the dream 
came and said to me, 
 soothingly: Go on sleeping, 
 you are not 
going to wake! You have no boil, 
 for you are riding on horseback, 
 and with a boil just there no one could ride! And the 
dream was successful;
 the pain was stifled, 
 and I went on 
sleeping.
 

But the dream was not satisfied with suggesting away the 
boil by tenaciously holding fast to an idea incompatible with 
the malady (thus behaving like the hallucinatory insanity of a 
mother who has lost her child, 
 or of a merchant who has lost his 
fortune) .
 In addition, 
 the details of the sensation denied and of 
the image used to suppress it serve the dream also as a means to 
connect other material actually present in the mind with the 
situation in the dream, 
 and to give this material representation.
 
I am riding on a gray horse — the colour of the horse exactly 
corresponds with the pepper-and-salt suit in which I last saw 
my colleague P.
 in the country.
 I have been warned that highly 
seasoned food is the cause of boils, 
 and in any case it is preferable 
as an etiological explanation to sugar, 
 which might be thought 
of in connection with furunculosis.
 My friend P.
 likes to ride 
the high horse with me ever since he took my place in the treatment of a female patient, 
 in whose case I had performed great 
feats ( Kunststucke : in the dream I sit the horse at first sideways, 
 
like a trick-rider, 
 Kunstreiter) , 
 but who really, 
 like the horse in 
the story of the Sunday equestrian, 
 led me wherever she wished.
 
Thus the horse comes to be a symbolic representation of a lady 
patient (in the dream it is highly intelligent ).
 I feel quite at 
home refers to the position which I occupied in the patient’s 
household until I was replaced by my colleague P.
 I thought 
you were safe in the saddle up there, 
 one of my few well-wishers 
among the eminent physicians of the city recently said to me, 
 
with reference to the same household.
 And it was a feat to practise psychotherapy for eight to ten hours a day, 
 while suffering 
such pain, 
 but I know that I cannot continue my peculiarly 
strenuous work for any length of time without perfect physical 
health, 
 and the dream is full of dismal allusions to the situation 
which would result if my illness continued (the note, 
 such as 
neurasthenics carry and show to their doctors) : Do not work, 
 
do not eat.
 On further interpretation I see that the dream-activity has succeeded in finding its way from the wish-situation of 
riding to some very early childish quarrels which must have occurred between myself and a nephew, 
 who is a year older than 
I, 
 and is now living in England.
 It has also taken up elements 
from my journeys in Italy ;
 the street in the dream is built up out 
of impressions of Verona and Siena.
 A still deeper interpretation 
leads to sexual dream-thoughts, 
 and I recall what the dream-allusions to that beautiful country were supposed to mean in the 
dream of a female patient who had never been to Italy {to Italy, 
 
German: genltalien = Genitalien — genitals ) ;
 at the same time 
there are references to the house in which I preceded my friend 
P.
 as physician, 
 and to the place where the boil is located.
 

In another dream I was similarly successful in warding off a 
threatened disturbance of my sleep;
 this time the threat came 
from a sensory stimulus.
 It was only chance, 
 however, 
 that enabled me to discover the connection between the dream and the 
accidental dream-stimulus, 
 and in this way to understand the 
dream.
 One midsummer morning in a Tyrolese mountain resort I 
woke with the knowledge that I had dreamed: The Pope is dead.
 
I was not able to interpret this short, 
 non-visual dream.
 I could 
remember only one possible basis of the dream, 
 namely, 
 that 
shortly before this the newspapers had reported that His Holiness was slightly indisposed.
 But in the course of the morning 
my wife asked me: Did you hear the dreadful tolling of the 
church bells this morning? I had no idea that I had heard it, 
 
but now I understood my dream.
 It was the reaction of my need 
for sleep to the noise by which the pious Tyroleans were trying 
to wake me.
 I avenged myself on them by the conclusion which 
formed the content of my dream, 
 and continued to sleep, 
 without 
any further interest in the tolling of the bells.
 

Among the dreams mentioned in the previous chapters there 
are several which might serve as examples of the elaboration of 
so-called nerve-stimuli.
 The dream of drinking in long draughts 
is such an example;
 here the somatic stimulus seems to be the 
sole source of the dream, 
 and the wish arising from the sensation 
— thirst — the only motive for dreaming.
 We find much the same 
thing in other simple dreams, 
 where the somatic stimulus is 
able of itself to generate a wish.
 The dream of the sick woman 
who throws the cooling apparatus from her cheek at night is an 
instance of an unusual manner of reacting to a pain-stimulus 
with a wish-fulfilment;
 it seems as though the patient had temporarily succeeded in making herself analgesic, 
 and accompanied 
this by ascribing her pains to a stranger.
 

My dream of the three Parcae is obviously a hunger-dream, 
 
but it has contrived to shift the need for food right back to the 
child's longing for its mother's breast, 
 and to use a harmless 
desire as a mask for a more serious one that cannot venture to 
express itself so openly.
 In the dream of Count Thun we were 
able to see by what paths an accidental physical need was 
brought into relation with the strongest, 
 but also the most rigorously repressed impulses of the psychic life.
 And when, 
 as in 
the case reported by Gamier, 
 the First Consul incorporates the 
sound of an exploding infernal machine into a dream of battle 
before it causes him to wake, 
 the true purpose for which alone 
psychic activity concerns itself with sensations during sleep is 
revealed with unusual clarity.
 A young lawyer, 
 who is full of 
his first great bankruptcy case, 
 and falls asleep in the afternoon, 
 
behaves just as the great Napoleon did.
 He dreams of a certain 
G.
 Reich in Hussiatyn, 
 whose acquaintance he has made in connection with the bankruptcy case, 
 but Hussiatyn (German: 
kusten, 
 to cough) forces itself upon his attention still further;
 he 
is obliged to wake, 
 only to hear his wife — who is suffering from 
bronchial catarrh — violently coughing.
 

Let us compare the dream of Napoleon I — who, 
 incidentally, 
 
was an excellent sleeper — with that of the sleepy student, 
 who 
was awakened by his landlady with the reminder that he had to 
go to the hospital, 
 and who thereupon dreamt himself into a bed 
in the hospital, 
 and then slept on, 
 the underlying reasoning being 
as follows: If I am already in the hospital, 
 I needn't get up to go 
there.
 This is obviously a convenience-dream;
 the sleeper frankly 
admits to himself his motive in dreaming;
 but he thereby reveals 
one of the secrets of dreaming in general.
 In a certain sense, 
 all 
dreams are convenience-dreams ;
 they serve the purpose of continuing to sleep instead of waking.
 The dream is the guardian of 
sleep, 
 not its disturber .
 In another place we shall have occasion 
to justify this conception in respect to the psychic factors that 
make for waking;
 but we can already demonstrate its applicability to the objective external stimuli.
 Either the mind does not 
concern itself at all with the causes of sensations during sleep, 
 if 
it is able to carry this attitude through as against the intensity 
of the stimuli, 
 and their significance, 
 of which it is well aware;
 or 
it employs the dream to deny these stimuli;
 or, 
 thirdly, 
 if it is 
obliged to recognize the stimuli, 
 it seeks that interpretation of 
them which will represent the actual sensation as a component of 
a desired situation which is compatible with sleep.
 The actual 
sensation is woven into the dream in order to deprive it of its 
reality.
 Napoleon is permitted to go on sleeping;
 it is only a 
dream-memory of the thunder of the guns at Arcole which is 
trying to disturb him.
 36 

The wish to sleep , 
 to which the conscious ego has adjusted 
itself, 
 and which ( together with the drcamrcensorship and the 
 secondary elaboration  to be mentioned later) represents the 
ego’s contribution to the dream, 
 must thus always be taken into 
account as a motive of dream-formation, 
 and every successful 
dream is a fulfilment of this wish.
 The relation of this general, 
 
constantly present, 
 and unvarying sleep-wish to the other wishes 
of which now one and now another is fulfilled by the dreamcontent, 
 will be the subject of later consideration.
 In the wish to 
sleep we have discovered a motive capable of supplying the deficiency in the theory of Striimpell and Wundt, 
 and of explaining 
the perversity and capriciousness of the interpretation of the 
external stimulus.
 The correct interpretation, 
 of which the sleeping mind is perfectly capable, 
 would involve active interest, 
 and 
would require the sleeper to wake;
 hence, 
 of those interpretations which are possible at all only such are admitted as are acceptable to the dictatorial censorship of the sleep-wish.
 The logic 
of dream situations would run, 
 for example: It is the nightingale, 
 and not the lark.
 For if it is the lark, 
 love’s night is at an 
end.
 From among the interpretations of the stimulus which are 
thus admissible, 
 that one is selected which can secure the best 
connection with the wish-impulses that are lying in wait in the 
mind.
 Thus everything is definitely determined, 
 and nothing is 
left to caprice.
 The misinterpretation is not an illusion, 
 but — if 
you will — an excuse.
 Here again, 
 as in substitution by displacement in the service of the dream-censorship, 
 we have an act of 
deflection of the normal psychic procedure.
 

If the external nerve-stimuli and the inner bodily stimuli are 
sufficiently intense to compel psychic attention, 
 they represent— 
that is, 
 if they result in dreaming at all, 
 and not in waking — a 
fixed point for dream-formation, 
 a nucleus in the dream-material, 
 
for which an appropriate wish-fulfilment is sought, 
 just as (see 
above) mediating ideas between two psychical dream-stimuli 
are sought.
 To this extent it is true of a number of dreams that 
the somatic element dictates the dream-content.
 In this extreme 
case even a wish that is not actually present may be aroused for 
the purpose of dream-formation.
 But the dream cannot do otherwise than represent a wish in some situation as fulfilled;
 it is, 
 
as it were, 
 confronted with the task of discovering what wish can 
be represented as fulfilled by the given sensation.
 Even if this 
given material is of a painful or disagreeable character, 
 yet it is 
not unserviceable for the purposes of dream-formation.
 The 
psychic life has at its disposal even wishes whose fulfilment 
evokes displeasure, 
 which seems a contradiction, 
 but becomes 
perfectly intelligible if we take into account the presence of two 
sorts of psychic instance and the censorship that subsists between them.
 

In the psychic life there exist, 
 as we have seen, 
 repressed 
wishes, 
 which belong to the first system, 
 and to whose fulfilment 
the second system is opposed.
 We do not mean this in a historic 
sense — that such wishes have once existed and have subsequently 
been destroyed.
 The doctrine of repression , 
 which we need in the 
study of psychoneuroses, 
 asserts that such repressed wishes still 
exist, 
 but simultaneously with an inhibition which weighs them 
down.
 Language has hit upon the truth when it speaks of the 
suppression (sub-pression, 
 or pushing under) of such impulses.
 The psychic mechanism which enables such suppressed 
wishes to force their way to realization is retained in being and 
in working order.
 But if it happens that such a suppressed wish 
is fulfilled, 
 the vanquished inhibition of the second system 
(which is capable of consciousness) is then expressed as discomfort.
 And, 
 in order to conclude this argument: If sensations of a 
disagreeable character which originate from somatic sources are 
present during sleep, 
 this constellation is utilized by the dreamactivity to procure the fulfilment— with more or less maintenance of the censorship — of an otherwise suppressed wish.
 

This state of affairs makes possible a certain number of 
anxiety-dreams, 
 while others of these dream-formations which 
are unfavourable to the wish-theory exhibit a different mechanism.
 For the anxiety in dreams may of course be of a psychoneurotic character, 
 originating in psychosexual excitation, 
 in 
which case, 
 the anxiety corresponds to repressed libido.
 Then 
this anxiety, 
 like the whole anxiety-dream, 
 has the significance 
of a neurotic symptom, 
 and we stand at the dividing-line where 
the wish-fulfilling tendency of dreams is frustrated.
 But in other 
anxiety-dreams the feeling of anxiety comes from somatic sources 
(as in the case of persons suffering from pulmonary or cardiac 
trouble, 
 with occasional difficulty in breathing), 
 and then it is 
used to help such strongly suppressed wishes to attain fulfilment 
in a dream, 
 the dreaming of which from psychic motives would 
have resulted in the same release of anxiety.
 It is not difficult to 
reconcile these two apparently contradictory cases.
 When two 
psychic formations, 
 an affective inclination and a conceptual 
content, 
 are intimately connected, 
 either one being actually 
present will evoke the other, 
 even in a dream ;
 now the anxiety of 
somatic origin evokes the suppressed conceptual content, 
 now 
it is the released conceptual content, 
 accompanied by sexual excitement, 
 which causes the release of anxiety.
 In the one case it 
may be said that a somatically determined affect is psychically 
interpreted;
 in the other case all is of psychic origin, 
 but the 
content which has been suppressed is easily replaced by a 
somatic interpretation which fits the anxiety.
 The difficulties 
which lie in the way of understanding all this have little to do 
with dreams;
 they are due to the fact that in discussing these 
points we are touching upon the problems of the development of 
anxiety and of repression.
 

The general aggregate of bodily sensation must undoubtedly 
be included among the dominant dream-stimuli of internal bodily 
origin.
 Not that it is capable of supplying the dream-content;
 
but it forces the dream-thoughts to make a choice from the material destined to serve the purpose of representation in the 
dream-content, 
 inasmuch as it brings within easy reach that part 
of the material which is adapted to its own character, 
 and holds 
the rest at a distance.
 Moreover, 
 this general feeling, 
 which survives from the preceding day, 
 is of course connected with the 
psychic residues that are significant for the dream.
 Moreover, 
 
this feeling itself may be either maintained or overcome in the 
dream, 
 so that it may, 
 if it is painful, 
 veer round into its opposite.
 

If the somatic sources of excitation during sleep — that is, 
 the 
sensations of sleep — are not of unusual intensity, 
 the part which 
they play in dream-formation is, 
 in my judgment, 
 similar to that 
of those impressions of the day which are still recent, 
 but of no 
great significance.
 I mean that they are utilized for the dreamformation if they are of such a kind that they can be united with 
the conceptual content of the psychic dream-source, 
 but not 
otherwise.
 They are treated as a cheap ever-ready material, 
 
which can be used whenever it is needed, 
 and not as valuable 
material which itself prescribes the manner in which it must be 
utilized.
 I might suggest the analogy of a connoisseur giving an 
artist a rare stone, 
 a piece of onyx, 
 for example, 
 in order that it 
may be fashioned into a work of art.
 Here the size of the stone, 
 
its colour, 
 and its markings help to decide what head or what 
scene shall be represented;
 while if he is dealing with a uniform 
and abundant material such as marble or sandstone, 
 the artist is 
guided only by the idea which takes shape in his mind.
 Only in 
this way, 
 it seems to me, 
 can we explain the fact that the dreamcontent furnished by physical stimuli of somatic origin which 
are not unusually accentuated does not make its appearance in 
all dreams and every night .
 38 

Perhaps an example which takes us back to the interpretation 
of dreams will best illustrate my meaning.
 One day I was trying 
to understand the significance of the sensation of being inhibited, 
 
of not being able to move from the spot, 
 of not being able to get 
something done, 
 etc.
, 
 which occurs so frequently in dreams, 
 and 
is so closely allied to anxiety.
 That night I had the following 
dream: I am very incompletely dressed, 
 and I go from a flat 
on the ground-floor up a flight of stairs to an upper story.
 In 
doing this I jump up three stairs at a time , 
 and I am glad to find 
that I can mount the stairs so quickly.
 Sudcnly I notice that a 
servant-maid is coming down the stairs — that is, 
 towards me.
 I 
am ashamed, 
 and try to hurry away, 
 and now comes this feeling 
of being inhibited;
 I am glued to the stairs, 
 and cannot move 
from the spot.
 

Analysis: The situation of the dream is taken from an everyday reality.
 In a house in Vienna I have two apartments, 
 which 
are connected only by the main staircase.
 My consultation-rooms 
and my study are on the raised ground-floor, 
 and my livingrooms are on the first floor.
 Late at night, 
 when I have finished 
my work downstairs, 
 I go upstairs to my bedroom.
 On the 
evening before the dream I had actually gone this short distance 
with my garments in disarray — that is, 
 I had taken off my collar, 
 
tie and cuffs;
 but in the dream this had changed into a more 
advanced, 
 but, 
 as usual, 
 indefinite degree of undress.
 It is a 
habit of mine to run up two or three steps at a time;
 moreover, 
 
there was a wish-fulfilment recognized even in the dream, 
 for 
the ease with which I run upstairs reassures me as to the condition of my heart.
 Further, 
 the manner in which I run upstairs 
is an effective contrast to the sensation of being inhibited, 
 which 
occurs in the second half of the dream.
 It shows me — what 
needed no proof — that dreams have no difficulty in representing 
motor actions fully and completely carried out;
 think, 
 for example, 
 of flying in dreams! 

But the stairs up which I go are not those of my own house;
 
at first I do not recognize them;
 only the person coming towards 
me informs me of their whereabouts.
 This woman is the maid of 
an old lady whom I visit twice daily in order to give her hypodermic injections;
 the stairs, 
 too, 
 are precisely similar to those 
which I have to climb twice a day in this old lady’s house.
 

How do these stairs and this woman get into my dre am ? The 
shame of not being fully dressed is undoubtedly of a sexual character;
 the servant of whom I dream is older than I, 
 surly, 
 and 
by no means attractive.
 These questions remind me of the following incident: When I pay my morning visit at this house I 
am usually seized with a desire to clear my throat;
 the sputum 
falls on the stairs.
 There is no spittoon on either of the two 
floors, 
 and I consider that the stairs should be kept clean not at 
my expense, 
 but rather by the provision of a spittoon.
 The 
housekeeper, 
 another elderly, 
 curmudgeonly person, 
 but, 
 as I 
willingly admit, 
 a woman of cleanly instincts, 
 takes a different 
view of the matter.
 She lies in wait for me, 
 to see whether I shall 
take the liberty referred to, 
 and if she sees that I do I can distinctly hear her growl.
 For days thereafter, 
 when we meet, 
 she 
refuses to greet me with the customary signs of respect.
 On the 
day before the dream the housekeeper’s attitude was reinforced 
by that of the maid.
 I had just finished my usual hurried visit to 
the patient when the servant confronted me in the ante-room, 
 
observing: You might as well have wiped your shoes to-day, 
 
doctor, 
 before you came into the room.
 The red carpet is all 
dirty again from your feet.
 This is the only justification for the 
appearance of the stairs and the maid in my dream.
 

Between my leaping upstairs and my spitting on the stairs 
there is an intimate connection.
 Pharyngitis and cardiac troubles 
are both supposed to be punishments for the vice of smoking, 
 on 
account of which vice my own housekeeper does not credit me 
with excessive tidiness, 
 so that my reputation suffers in both 
the houses which my dream fuses into one.
 

I must postpone the further interpretation of this dream until 
I can indicate the origin of the typical dream of being incompletely clothed.
 In the meantime, 
 as a provisional deduction 
from the dream just related, 
 I note that the dream-sensation of 
inhibited movement is always aroused at a point where a certain 
connection requires it.
 A peculiar condition of my motor system 
during sleep cannot be responsible for this dream-content, 
 since 
a moment earlier I found myself, 
 as though in confirmation of 
this fact, 
 skipping lightly up the stairs.
 

D.
 TYPICAL DREAMS 

Generally speaking, 
 we are not in a position to interpret another 
person’s dream if he is unwilling to furnish us with the unconscious thoughts which lie behind the dream-content, 
 and for this 
reason the practical applicability of our method of dream-interpretation is often seriously restricted .
 37 But there are dreams 
which exhibit a complete contrast to the individual’s customary 
liberty to endow his dream-world with a special individuality, 
 
thereby making it inaccessible to an alien understanding: there 
are a number of dreams which almost every one has dreamed in 
the same manner, 
 and of which we are accustomed to assume 
that they have the same significance in the case of every dreamer.
 
A peculiar interest attaches to these typical dreams, 
 because, 
 no 
matter who dreams them, 
 they presumably all derive from the 
same sources, 
 so that they would seem to be particularly fitted 
to provide us with information as to the sources of dreams.
 

With quite special expectations, 
 therefore, 
 we shall proceed 
to test our technique of dream-interpretation on these typical 
dreams, 
 and only with extreme reluctance shall wo admit that 
precisely in respect of this material our method is not fully verified.
 In the interpretation of typical dreams we as a rule fail to 
obtain those associations from the dreamer which in other cases 
have led us to comprehension of the dream, 
 or else these associations are confused and inadequate, 
 so that they do not help us 
to solve our problem.
 

Why this is the case, 
 and how we can remedy this defect in 
our technique, 
 are points which will be discussed in a later chapter.
 The reader will then understand why I can deal with only 
a few of the group of typical dreams in this chapter, 
 and why I 
have postponed the discussion of the others.
 

87 The statement that our method of dream-interpretation is inapplicable 
when we have not at our disposal the dreamer’s association-material must 
be qualified.
 In one case our work of interpretation is independent of these 
associations: namely, 
 when the dreamer makes use of symbolic elements in 
his dream.
 We then employ what is, 
 strictly speaking, 
 a second or auxiliary 
method of dream-interpretation ( vid.
 inf .
) .
 

(a) The Embarrassment-Dream of Nakedness 

In a dream in which one is naked or scantily clad in the presence 
of strangers, 
 it sometimes happens that one is not in the least 
ashamed of one’s condition.
 But the dream of nakedness de m ands 
our attention only when shame and embarrassment are felt in it, 
 
when one wishes to escape or to hide, 
 and when one feels the 
strange inhibition of being unable to stir from the spot, 
 and of 
being utterly powerless to alter the painful situation.
 It is only 
in this connection that the dream is typical;
 otherwise the 
nucleus of its content may be involved in all sorts of other connections, 
 or may be replaced by individual amplifications.
 The 
essential point is that one has a painful feeling of shame, 
 and 
is anxious to hide one’s nakedness, 
 usually by means of locomotion, 
 but is absolutely unable to do so.
 I believe that the great 
majority of my readers will at some time have found themselves 
in this situation in a dream.
 

The nature and manner of the exposure is usually rather 
vague.
 The dreamer will say, 
 perhaps, 
 I was in my chemise/’ 
but this is rarely a clear image;
 in most cases the lack of clothing 
is so indeterminate that it is described in narrating the dream by 
an alternative: I was in my chemise or my petticoat.
 As a rule 
the deficiency in clothing is not serious enough to justify the 
feeling of shame attached to it.
 For a man who has served in 
the army, 
 nakedness is often replaced by a manner of dressing 
that is contrary to regulations.
 I was in the street without my 
sabre, 
 and I saw some officers approaching, 
 or I had no collar, 
 
or I was wearing checked civilian trousers, 
 etc.
 

The persons before whom one is ashamed are almost always 
strangers, 
 whose faces remain indeterminate.
 It never happens, 
 
in the typical dream, 
 that one is reproved or even noticed on 
account of the lack of clothing which causes one such embarrassment.
 On the contrary, 
 the people in the dream appear to 
be quite indifferent;
 or, 
 as I was able to note in one particularly 
vivid dream, 
 they have stiff and solemn expressions.
 This gives 
us food for thought.
 



142 THE INTEki’KETATION 01>' DREAMS 

The dreamer’s embarrassment and the spectator’s indifference 
constitute a contradiction such as often occurs in dreams.
 It 
would be more in keeping with the dreamer's feelings if the 
strangers were to look at him in astonishment, 
 or were to laugh 
at him, 
 or be outraged.
 I think, 
 however, 
 that this obnoxious 
feature has been displaced by wish-fulfilment, 
 while the embarrassment is for some reason retained, 
 so that the two components are not in agreement.
 We have an interesting proof that 
the dream which is partially distorted by wish-fulfilment has 
not been properly understood;
 for it has been made the basis of 
a fairy-tale familiar to us all in Andersen’s version of 'The Emperor’s New Clothes, 
 and it has more recently received poetical 
treatment by Fulda in The Talisman.
 In Andersen’s fairy-tale 
we are told of two impostors who weave a costly garment for the 
Emperor, 
 which shall, 
 however, 
 be visible only to the good and 
true.
 The Emperor goes forth clad in this invisible garment, 
 and 
since the imaginary fabric serves as a sort of touchstone, 
 the 
people are frightened into behaving as though they did not 
notice the Emperor’s nakedness.
 

But this is really the situation in our dream.
 It is not very 
venturesome to assume that the unintelligible dream-content has 
provided an incentive to invent a state of undress which gives 
meaning to the situation present in the memory.
 This situation 
is thereby robbed of its original meaning, 
 and made to serve alien 
ends.
 But we shall see that such a misunderstanding of the 
dream-content often occurs through the conscious activity of a 
second psychic system, 
 and is to be recognized as a factor of 
the final form of the dream;
 and further, 
 that in the development of obsessions and phobias similar misunderstandings — still, 
 
of course, 
 within the same psychic personality — play a decisive 
part.
 It is even possible to specify whence the material for the 
fresh interpretation of the dream is taken.
 The impostor is the 
dream, 
 the Emperor is the dreamer himself, 
 and the moralizing 
tendency betrays a hazy knowledge of the fact that there is a 
question, 
 in the latent dream-content, 
 of forbidden wishes, 
 victims of repression.
 The connection in which such dreams appear 
during my analyses of neurotics proves beyond a doubt that a 
memory of the dreamer’s earliest childhood lies at the foundation of the dream.
 Only in our childhood was there a time when 
we were seen by our relatives, 
 as well as by strange nurses, 
 
servants and visitors, 
 in a state of insufficient clothing, 
 and at 
that time we were not ashamed of our nakedness .
 38 In the case 
of many rather older children it may be observed that being undressed has an exciting effect upon them, 
 instead of making them 
feel ashamed.
 They laugh, 
 leap about, 
 slap or thump their own 
bodies;
 the mother, 
 or whoever is present, 
 scolds them, 
 saying: 
Fie, 
 that is shameful — you mustn’t do that! Children often 
show a desire to display themselves;
 it is hardly possible to pass 
through a village in country districts without meeting a two- or 
three-year-old child who lifts up his or her blouse or frock 
before the traveller, 
 possibly in his honour.
 One of my patients 
has retained in his conscious memory a scene from his eighth 
year, 
 in which, 
 after undressing for bed, 
 he wanted to dance into 
his little sister’s room in his shirt, 
 but was prevented by the 
servant.
 In the history of the childhood of neurotics exposure 
before children of the opposite sex plays a prominent part;
 in 
paranoia the delusion of being observed while dressing and undressing may be directly traced to these experiences;
 and among 
those who have remained perverse there is a class in whom the 
childish impulse is accentuated into a symptom: the class of 
exhibitionists .
 

This age of childhood, 
 in which the sense of shame is unknown, 
 seems a paradise when we look back upon it later, 
 and 
paradise itself is nothing but the mass-phantasy of the childhood 
of the individual.
 This is why in paradise men are naked and 
unashamed, 
 until the moment arrives when shame and fear 
awaken;
 expulsion follows, 
 and sexual life and cultural development begin.
 Into this paradise dreams can take us back every 
night;
 we have already ventured the conjecture that the impressions of our earliest childhood (from the prehistoric period until 
about the end of the third year) crave reproduction for their 
own sake, 
 perhaps without further reference to their content, 
 so 
that their repetition is a wish- fulfilment.
 Dreams of nakedness, 
 
then, 
 are exhibition-dreams .
 30 

The nucleus of an exhibition-dream is furnished by one’s own 
person, 
 which is seen not as that of a child, 
 but as it exists in the 
present, 
 and by the idea of scanty clothing which emerges indistinctly, 
 owing to the superimposition of so many later situations 
of being partially clothed, 
 or out of consideration for the censorship;
 to these elements are added the persons in whose presence one is ashamed.
 I know of no example in which the actual 
spectators of these infantile exhibitions reappear in a dream;
 
for a dream is hardly ever a simple recollection.
 Strangely 
enough, 
 those persons who are the objects of our sexual interest 
in childhood are omitted from all reproductions, 
 in dreams, 
 in 
hysteria or in obsessional neurosis;
 paranoia alone restores the 
spectators, 
 and is fanatically convinced of their presence, 
 although they remain unseen.
 The substitute for these persons 
offered by the dream, 
 the number of strangers who take no 
notice of the spectacle offered them, 
 is precisely the counter-wish 
to that single intimately-known person for whom the exposure 
was intended.
 A number of strangers, 
 moreover, 
 often occur in 
dreams in all sorts of other connections;
 as a counter-wish they 
always signify a secret .
 40 It will be seen that even that restitution of the old state of affairs that occurs in paranoia complies 
with this counter-tendency.
 One is no longer alone;
 one is quite 
positively being watched;
 but the spectators are a number of 
strange, 
 curiously indeterminate people.
 

Furthermore, 
 repression finds a place in the exhibition-dream.
 
For the disagreeable sensation of the dream is, 
 of course, 
 the 
reaction on the part of the second psychic instance to the fact 
that the exhibitionistic scene which has been condemned by the 
censorship has nevertheless succeeded in presenting itself.
 The 
only way to avoid this sensation would be to refrain from reviving the scene.
 

Ferenczi has recorded a number of interesting dreams of nakedness in 
women which were without difficulty traced to the infantile delight in 
exhibitionism, 
 but which differ in many features from the typical dream 
of nakedness discussed above.
 

In a later chapter we shall deal once again with the feeling 
of inhibition.
 In our dreams it represents to perfection a conflict 
of the will, 
 a denial.
 According to our unconscious purpose, 
 the 
exhibition is to proceed;
 according to the demands of the censorship, 
 it is to come to an end.
 

The relation of our typical dreams to fairy-tales and other 
fiction and poetry is neither sporadic nor accidental.
 Sometimes 
the penetrating insight of the poet has analytically recognized 
the process of transformation of which the poet is otherwise the 
instrument, 
 and has followed it up in the reverse direction;
 that 
is to say, 
 has traced a poem to a dream.
 A friend has called my 
attention to the following passage in G.
 Keller’s Der Grtine 
Heinrich: I do not wish, 
 dear Lee, 
 that you should ever come to 
realize from experience the exquisite and piquant truth in the 
situation of Odysseus, 
 when he appears, 
 naked and covered with 
mud, 
 before Nausicaa and her playmates! Would you like to 
know what it means? Let us for a moment consider the incident 
closely.
 If you are ever parted from your home, 
 and from all 
that is dear to you, 
 and wander about in a strange country;
 if 
you have seen much and experienced much;
 if you have cares and 
sorrows, 
 and are, 
 perhaps, 
 utterly wretched and forlorn, 
 you 
will some night inevitably dream that you are approaching your 
home;
 you will see it shining and glittering in the loveliest 
colours;
 lovely and gracious figures will come to meet you;
 and 
then you will suddenly discover that you are ragged, 
 naked, 
 and 
covered with dust.
 An indescribable feeling of shame and fear 
overcomes you ;
 you try to cover yourself, 
 to hide, 
 and you wake 
up bathed in sweat.
 As long as humanity exists, 
 this will be the 
dream of the care-laden, 
 tempest-tossed man, 
 and thus Homer 
has drawn this situation from the profoundest depths of the 
eternal nature of humanity.
 

What are the profoundest depths of the eternal nature of 
humanity, 
 which the poet commonly hopes to awaken in his 
listeners, 
 but these stirrings of the psychic life which are rooted 
in that age of childhood, 
 which subsequently become prehistoric? Childish wishes, 
 now suppressed and forbidden, 
 break into 
the dream behind the unobjectionable and permissibly conscious 
wishes of the homeless man, 
 and it is for this reason that the 
dream which is objectified in the legend of Nausicaa regularly 
develops into an anxiety-dream.
 

My own dream of hurrying upstairs, 
 which presently changed 
into being glued to the stairs, 
 is likewise an exhibition-dream, 
 
for it reveals the essential ingredients of such a dream.
 It must 
therefore be possible to trace it back to experiences in my childhood, 
 and the knowledge of these should enable us to conclude 
how far the servant's behaviour to me (i.
e.
 her reproach that I 
had soiled the carpet) helped her to secure the position which 
she occupies in the dream.
 Now I am actually able to furnish the 
desired explanation.
 One learns in a psychoanalysis to interpret 
temporal proximity by material connection;
 two ideas which 
are apparently without connection, 
 but which occur in immediate 
succession, 
 belong to a unity which has to be deciphered;
 just 
as an a and a b, 
 when written in succession, 
 must be pronounced 
as one syllable, 
 ab.
 It is just the same with the interrelations of 
dreams.
 The dream of the stairs has been taken from a series of 
dreams with whose other members I am familiar, 
 having interpreted them.
 A dream included in this series must belong to the 
same context.
 Now, 
 the other dreams of the series are based on 
the memory of a nurse to whom I was entrusted for a season, 
 
from the time when I was still at the breast to the age of two 
and a half, 
 and of whom a hazy recollection has remained in 
my consciousness.
 According to information which I recently 
obtained from my mother, 
 she was old and ugly, 
 but very intelligent and thorough;
 according to the inferences which I am 
justified in drawing from my dreams, 
 she did not always treat 
me quite kindly, 
 but spoke harshly to me when I showed insufficient understanding of the necessity for cleanliness.
 Inasmuch 
as the maid endeavoured to continue my education in this respect, 
 she is entitled to be treated, 
 in my dream, 
 as an incarnation of the prehistoric old woman.
 It is to be assumed, 
 of course, 
 
that the child was fond of his teacher in spite of her harsh behaviour .


(6) Dreams of the Death of Beloved Persons 

Another series of dreams which may be called typical are those 
whose content is that a beloved relative, 
 a parent, 
 brother, 
 sister, 
 
child, 
 or the like, 
 has died.
 We must at once distinguish two 
classes of such dreams: those in which the dreamer remains unmoved, 
 and those in which he feels profoundly grieved by the 
death of the beloved person, 
 even expressing this grief by shedding tears in his sleep.
 

We may ignore the dreams of the first group;
 they have no 
claim to be reckoned as typical.
 If they are analysed, 
 it is found 
that they signify something that is not contained in them, 
 that 
they are intended to mask another wish of some kind.
 This is the 
case in the dream of the aunt who sees the only son of her sister 
lying on a bier (p.
 60).
 The dream does not mean that she 
desires the death of her little nephew;
 as we have learned, 
 it 
merely conceals the wish to see a certain beloved person again 
after a long separation — the same person whom she had seen 
after as long an interval at the funeral of another nephew.
 This 
wish, 
 which is the real content of the dream, 
 gives no cause for 
sorrow, 
 and for that reason no sorrow is felt in the dream.
 We 
see here that the feeling contained in the dream does not belong 
to the manifest, 
 but to the latent dream-content, 
 and that the 
affective content has remained free from the distortion which 
has befallen the conceptual content.
 

It is otherwise with those dreams in which the death of a beloved relative is imagined, 
 and in which a painful affect is felt.
 
These signify, 
 as their content tells us, 
 the wish that the person 
in question might die;
 and since I may here expect that the 
feelings of all my readers and of all who have had such dreams 
will lead them to reject my explanation, 
 I must endeavour to 
rest my proof on the broadest possible basis.
 

We have already cited a dream from which we could see that 
the wishes represented as fulfilled in dreams are not always current wishes.
 They may also be bygone, 
 discarded, 
 buried and 
repressed wishes, 
 which we must nevertheless credit with a sort 
of continued existence, 
 merely on account of their reappearance 
in a dream.
 They are not dead, 
 like persons who have died, 
 in 
the sense that we know death, 
 but are rather like the shades in 
the Odyssey which awaken to a certain degree of life so soon 
as they have drunk blood.
 The dream of the dead child in the 
box (p.
 62) contained a wish that had been present fifteen 
years earlier, 
 and which had at that time been frankly admitted 
as real.
 Further — and this, 
 perhaps, 
 is not unimportant from the 
standpoint of the theory of dreams — a recollection from the 
dreamer’s earliest childhood was at the root of this wish also.
 
When the dreamer was a little child— but exactly when cannot 
be definitely determined — she heard that her mother, 
 during the 
pregnancy of which she was the outcome, 
 had fallen into a profound emotional depression, 
 and had passionately wished for 
the death of the child in her womb.
 Having herself grown up and 
become pregnant, 
 she was only following the example of her 
mother.
 

If anyone dreams that his father or mother, 
 his brother or 
sister, 
 has died, 
 and his dream expresses grief, 
 I should never 
adduce this as proof that he wishes any of them dead now .
 The 
theory of dreams does not go as far as to require this ;
 it is satisfied with concluding that the dreamer has wished them dead 
at some time or other during his childhood.
 I fear, 
 however, 
 that 
this limitation will not go far to appease my critics;
 probably 
they will just as energetically deny the possibility that they ever 
had such thoughts, 
 as they protest that they do not harbour them 
now.
 I must, 
 therefore, 
 reconstruct a portion of the submerged 
infantile psychology on the basis of the evidence of the present.
 42 

Let us first of all consider the relation of children to their 
brothers and sisters.
 I do not know why we presuppose that it 
must be a loving one, 
 since examples of enmity among adult 
brothers and sisters are frequent in everyone’s experience, 
 and 
since we are so often able to verify the fact that this estrangement 
originated during childhood, 
 or has always existed.
 Moreover, 
 many adults who to-day are devoted to their brothers and 
sisters, 
 and support them in adversity, 
 lived with them in almost 
continuous enmity during their childhood.
 The elder child illtreated the younger, 
 slandered him, 
 and robbed him of his toys;
 
the younger was consumed with helpless fury against the elder, 
 
envied and feared him, 
 or his earliest impulse toward liberty 
and his first revolt against injustice were directed against his 
oppressor.
 The parents say that the children do not agree, 
 and 
cannot find the reason for it.
 It is not difficult to see that the 
character even of a well-behaved child is not the character we 
should wish to find in an adult.
 A child is absolutely egoistical;
 
he feels his wants acutely, 
 and strives remorselessly to satisfy 
them, 
 especially against his competitors, 
 other children, 
 and first 
of all against his brothers and sisters.
 And yet we do not on that 
account call a child wicked — we call him naughty;
 he is 
not responsible for his misdeeds, 
 either in our own judgment or 
in the eyes of the law.
 And this is as it should be;
 for we may 
expect that within the very period of life which we reckon as 
childhood, 
 altruistic impulses and morality will awake in the 
little egoist, 
 and that, 
 in the words of Meynert, 
 a secondary ego 
will overlay and inhibit the primary ego.
 Morality, 
 of course, 
 
does not develop simultaneously in all its departments, 
 and furthermore, 
 the duration of the amoral period of childhood differs 
in different individuals.
 Where this morality fails to develop we 
are prone to speak of degeneration;
 but here the case is obviously one of arrested development.
 Where the primary character 
is already overlaid by the later development it may be at least 
partially uncovered again by an attack of hysteria.
 The correspondence between the so-called hysterical character and that 
of a naughty child is positively striking.
 The obsessional neurosis, 
 
on the other hand, 
 corresponds to a super-morality, 
 which develops as a strong reinforcement against the primary character 
that is threatening to revive.
 

Many persons, 
 then, 
 who now love their brothers and sisters, 
 
and who would feel bereaved by their death, 
 harbour in their 
unconscious hostile wishes, 
 survivals from an earlier period, 
 
wishes which are able to realize themselves in dreams.
 It is, 
 however, 
 
quite especially interesting to observe the behaviour of 
little children up to their third and fourth year towards their 
younger brothers or sisters.
Sofar the child has been the only one;
 
now he is informed that the stork has brought a new baby.
 The 
child inspects the new arrival, 
 and expresses his opinion with 
decision: The stork had better take it back again ! 43 

I seriously declare it as my opinion that a child is able to 
estimate the disadvantages which he has to expect on account of 
a new-comer.
 A connection of mine, 
 who now gets on very well 
with a sister, 
 who is four years her junior, 
 responded to the news 
of this sister’s arrival with the reservation: But I shan’t give 
her my red cap, 
 anyhow.
 If the child should come to realize 
only at a later stage that its happiness may be prejudiced by a 
younger brother or sister, 
 its enmity will be aroused at this 
period.
 I know of a case where a girl, 
 not three years of age, 
 tried 
to strangle an infant in its cradle, 
 because she suspected that its 
continued presence boded her no good.
 Children at this time of 
life are capable of a jealousy that is perfectly evident and extremely intense.
 Again, 
 perhaps the little brother or sister really 
soon disappears, 
 and the child once more draws to himself the 
whole affection of the household;
 then a new child is sent by 
the stork;
 is it not natural that the favourite should conceive the 
wish that the new rival may meet the same fate as the earlier 
one, 
 in order that he may be as happy as he was before the birth 
of the first child, 
 and during the interval after his death ? 44 Of 
course, 
 this attitude of the child towards the younger brother or 
sister is, 
 under normal circumstances, 
 a mere function of the 
difference of age.
 After a certain interval the maternal instincts 
of the older girl will be awakened towards the helpless new-born 
infant.
 

Feelings of hostility towards brothers and sisters must occur 
far more frequently in children than is observed by their obtuse 
elders .
 45 

In the case of my own children, 
 who followed one another 
rapidly, 
 I missed the opportunity of making such observations.
 
I am now retrieving it, 
 thanks to my little nephew, 
 whose undisputed domination was disturbed after fifteen months by the 
arrival of a feminine rival.
 I hear, 
 it is true, 
 that the young man 
behaves very chivalrously toward his little sister, 
 that he kisses 
her hand and strokes her;
 but in spite of this I have convinced 
myself that even before the completion of his second year he is 
using his new command of language to criticize this person, 
 who, 
 
to him, 
 after all, 
 seems superfluous.
 Whenever the conversation 
turns upon her he chimes in, 
 and cries angrily: Too (l)ittle, 
 
too (l)ittle ! >7 During the last few months, 
 since the child has 
outgrown this disparagement, 
 owing to her splendid development, 
 he has found another reason for his insistence that she 
does not deserve so much attention.
 He reminds us, 
 on every 
suitable pretext: She hasn't any teeth .
 46 We all of us recollect 
the case of the eldest daughter of another sister of mine.
 The 
child, 
 who was then six years of age, 
 spent a full half-hour in 
going from one aunt to another with the question: Lucie can't 
understand that yet, 
 can she? Lucie was her rival— two and a 
half years younger.
 

I have never failed to come across this dream of the death of 
brothers or sisters, 
 denoting an intense hostility, 
 e.
g.
 I have met 
it in all my female patients.
 I have met with only one exception, 
 
which could easily be interpreted into a confirmation of the rule.
 
Once, 
 in the course of a sitting, 
 when I was explaining this state 
of affairs to a female patient, 
 since it seemed to have some 
bearing on the symptoms under consideration that day, 
 she 
answered, 
 to my astonishment, 
 that she had never had such 
dreams.
 But another dream occurred to her, 
 which presumably 
had nothing to do with the case — a dream which she had first 
dreamed at the age of four, 
 when she was the youngest child, 
 
and had since then dreamed repeatedly.
 A number of children , 
 
all her brothers and sisters with her boy and girl cousins, 
 were 
romping about in a meadow .
 Suddenly they all grew wings, 
 flew 
up, 
 and were gone  She had no idea of the significance of this 
dream;
 but we can hardly fail to recognize it as a dream of the 
death of all the brothers and sisters, 
 in its original form, 
 and 
but little influenced by the censorship.
 I will venture to add the 
following analysis of it: on the death of one out of this large 
number of children — in this case the children of two brothers 
were brought up together as brothers and sisters — would not 
our dreamer, 
 at that time not yet four years of age, 
 have asked 
some wise, 
 grown-up person: What becomes of children when 
they are dead? The answer would probably have been: They 
grow wings and become angels.
 After this explanation, 
 all the 
brothers and sisters and cousins in the dream now have wings, 
 
like angels and — this is the important point — they fly away.
 
Our little angel-maker is left alone: just think, 
 the only one out 
of such a crowd I That the children romp about a meadow, 
 from 
which they fly away, 
 points almost certainly to butterflies — it 
is as though the child had been influenced by the same association of ideas which led the ancients to imagine Psyche, 
 the soul, 
 
with the wings of a butterfly.
 

Perhaps some readers will now object that the inimical impulses of children toward their brothers and sisters may perhaps 
be admitted, 
 but how does the childish character arrive at such 
heights of wickedness as to desire the death of a rival or a 
stronger playmate, 
 as though all misdeeds could be atoned for 
only by death? Those who speak in this fashion forget that the 
child’s idea of being dead has little but the word in common 
with our own.
 The child knows nothing of the horrors of decay, 
 
of shivering in the cold grave, 
 of the terror of the infinite Nothing, 
 the thought of which the adult, 
 as all the myths of the 
hereafter testify, 
 finds so intolerable.
 The fear of death is alien 
to the child;
 and so he plays with the horrid word, 
 and threatens 
another child: If you do that again, 
 you will die, 
 just like 
Francis died;
 at which the poor mother shudders, 
 unable perhaps to forget that the greater proportion of mortals do not 
survive beyond the years of childhood.
 Even at the age of eight, 
 
a child returning from a visit to a natural history museum may 
say to her mother: Mamma, 
 I do love you so;
 if you ever die, 
 J 
am going to have you stuffed and set you up here in the room, 
 so 
that I can always, 
 always see you! So different from our own 
is the childish conception of being dead .
 47 

Being dead means, 
 for the child, 
 who has been spared the 
sight of the suffering that precedes death, 
 much the same as being gone, 
 and ceasing to annoy the survivors.
 The child does 
not distinguish the means by which this absence is brought 
about, 
 whether by distance, 
 or estrangement, 
 or death .
 48 If, 
 during the child’s prehistoric years, 
 a nurse has been dismissed, 
 and 
if his mother dies a little while later, 
 the two experiences, 
 as we 
discover by analysis, 
 form links of a chain in his memory.
 The 
fact that the child does not very intensely miss those who are 
absent has been realized, 
 to her sorrow, 
 by many a mother, 
 
when she has returned home from an absence of several weeks, 
 
and has been told, 
 upon inquiry: The children have not asked 
for their mother once.
 But if she really departs to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns, 
 the 
children seem at first to have forgotten her, 
 and only subsequently do they begin to remember their dead mother.
 

While, 
 therefore, 
 the child has its motives for desiring the 
absence of another child, 
 it is lacking in all those restraints 
which would prevent it from clothing this wish in the form of a 
death-wish;
 and the psychic reaction to dreams of a death-wish 
proves that, 
 in spite of all the differences of content, 
 the wish in 
the case of the child is after all identical with the corresponding 
wish in an adult.
 

If, 
 then, 
 the death-wish of a child in respect of his brothers 
and sisters is explained by his childish egoism, 
 which makes him 
regard his brothers and sisters as rivals, 
 how are we to account 
for the same wish in respect of his parents, 
 who bestow their 
love on him, 
 and satisfy his needs, 
 and whose preservation he 
ought to desire for these very egoistical reasons? 

Towards a solution of this difficulty we may be guided by our 
knowledge that the very great majority of dreams of the death 
of a parent refer to the parent of the same sex as the dreamer, 
 
so that a man generally dreams of the death of his father, 
 and 
a woman of the death of her mother.
 I do not claim that this 
happens constantly;
 but that it happens in a great majority of 
cases is so evident that it requires explanation by some factor of 
general significance .
 49 Broadly speaking, 
 it is as though a sexual 
preference made itself felt at an early age, 
 as though the boy 
regarded his father, 
 and the girl her mother, 
 as a rival in love — 
by whose removal he or she could but profit.
 

Before rejecting this idea as monstrous, 
 let the reader again 
consider the actual relations between parents and children.
 We 
must distinguish between the traditional standard of conduct, 
 
the filial piety expected in this relation, 
 and what daily observation shows us to be the fact.
 More than one occasion for enmity 
lies hidden amidst the relations of parents and children;
 conditions are present in the greatest abundance under which wishes 
which cannot pass the censorship are bound to arise.
 Let us first 
consider the relation between father and son.
 In my opinion the 
sanctity with which we have endorsed the injunctions of the 
Decalogue dulls our perception of the reality.
 Perhaps we hardly 
dare permit ourselves to perceive that the greater part of humanity neglects to obey the fifth commandment.
 In the lowest 
as well as in the highest strata of human society, 
 filial piety 
towards parents is wont to recede before other interests.
 The 
obscure legends which have been handed down to us from the 
primeval ages of human society in mythology and folklore give 
a deplorable idea of the despotic power of the father, 
 and the 
ruthlessness with which it was exercised.
 Kronos devours his 
children, 
 as the wild boar devours the litter of the sow;
 Zeus 
emasculates his father 50 and takes his place as ruler.
 The more 
tyrannically the father ruled in the ancient family, 
 the more 
surely must the son, 
 as his appointed successor, 
 have assumed 
the position of an enemy, 
 and the greater must have been his 
impatience to attain to supremacy through the death of his 
father.
 Even in our own middle-class families the father commonly fosters the growth of the germ of hatred which is naturally 
inherent in the paternal relation, 
 by refusing to allow the son to 
be a free agent or by denying him the means of becoming so.
 A 
physician often has occasion to remark that a son’s grief at the 
loss of his father cannot quench his gratification that he has at 
last obtained his freedom.
 Fathers, 
 as a rule, 
 cling desperately 
to as much of the sadly antiquated potestas patris jamilias as 
still survives in our modern society, 
 and the poet who, 
 like 
foreground of his drama is sure of his effect.
 The causes of conflict between mother and daughter arise when the daughter 
grows up and finds herself watched by her mother when she 
longs for real sexual freedom, 
 while the mother is reminded by 
the budding beauty of her daughter that for her the time has 
come to renounce sexual claims.
 

All these circumstances are obvious to everyone, 
 but they do 
not help us to explain dreams of the death of their parents in 
persons for whom filial piety has long since come to be unquestionable.
 We are, 
 however, 
 preparing by the foregoing discussion to look for the origin of a death-wish in the earliest years 
of childhood.
 

In the case of psychoneurotics, 
 analysis confirms this conjecture beyond all doubt.
 For analysis tells us that the sexual 
wishes of the child— in so far as they deserve this designation 
in their nascent state — awaken at a very early age, 
 and that 
the earliest affection of the girl-child is lavished on the father, 
 
while the earliest infantile desires of the boy are directed upon 
the mother.
 For the boy the father, 
 and for the girl the mother, 
 
becomes an obnoxious rival, 
 and we have already shown, 
 in the 
case of brothers and sisters, 
 how readily in children this feeling 
leads to the death-wish.
 As a general rule, 
 sexual selection soon 
makes its appearance in the parent;
 it is a natural tendency for 
the father to spoil his little daughters, 
 and for the mother to 
take the part of the sons, 
 while both, 
 so long as the glamour of 
sex does not prejudice their judgment, 
 are strict in training the 
children.
 The child is perfectly conscious of this partiality, 
 and 
offers resistance to the parent who opposes it.
 To find love in an 
adult is for the child not merely the satisfaction of a special 
need;
 it means also that the child’s will is indulged in all other 
respects.
 Thus the child is obeying its own sexual instinct, 
 and 
at the same time reinforcing the stimulus proceeding from the 
parents, 
 when its choice between the parents corresponds with 
their own.
 

The signs of these infantile tendencies are for the most part 
overlooked;
 and yet some of them may be observed even after 
the early years of childhood.
 An eight-year-old girl of my acquaintance, 
 
whenever her mother is called away from the table, 
 
takes advantage of her absence to proclaim herself her successor.
 Now I shall be Mamma;
 Karl, 
 do you want some more 
vegetables? Have some more, 
 do, 
 etc.
 A particularly clever and 
lively little girl, 
 not yet four years of age, 
 in whom this trait of 
child psychology is unusually transparent, 
 says frankly: Now 
mummy can go away;
 then daddy must marry me, 
 and I will be 
his wife.
 Nor does this wish by any means exclude the possibility that the child may most tenderly love its mother.
 If the little 
boy is allowed to sleep at his mother’s side whenever his father 
goes on a journey, 
 and if after his father’s return he has to go 
back to the nursery, 
 to a person whom he likes far less, 
 the wish 
may readily arise that his father might always be absent, 
 so 
that he might keep his place beside his dear, 
 beautiful mamma;
 
and the father’s death is obviously a means for the attainment 
of this wish;
 for the child’s experience has taught him that 
dead folks, 
 like grandpapa, 
 for example, 
 are always absent;
 
they never come back.
 

While such observations of young children readily accommodate themselves to the interpretation suggested, 
 they do not, 
 it 
is true, 
 carry the complete conviction which is forced upon a 
physician by the psychoanalysis of adult neurotics.
 The dreams 
of neurotic patients are communicated with preliminaries of 
such a nature that their interpretation as wish-dreams becomes 
inevitable.
 One day I find a lady depressed and weeping.
 She 
says: I do not want to see my relatives any more;
 they must 
shudder at me.
 Thereupon, 
 almost without any transition, 
 she 
tells me that she has remembered a dream, 
 whose significance, 
 
of course, 
 she does not understand.
 She dreamed it when she 
was four years old, 
 and it was this: A fox or a lynx is walking 
about the roof ;
 then something jails down , 
 or she falls down , 
 
and after that , 
 her mother is carried out of the house — dead;
 
whereat the dreamer weeps bitterly.
 I have no sooner informed 
her that this dream must signify a childish wish to see her 
mother dead, 
 and that it is because of this dream that she thinks 
that her relatives must shudder at her, 
 then she furnishes material in explanation of the dream.
 Lynx-eye is an opprobrious 
epithet which a street boy once bestowed on her when she was a 
very small child;
 and when she was three years old a brick or tile 
fell on her mother’s head, 
 so that she bled profusely.
 

I once had occasion to make a thorough study of a young girl 
who was passing through various psychic states.
 In the state of 
frenzied confusion with which her illness began, 
 the patient 
manifested a quite peculiar aversion for her mother;
 she struck 
her and abused her whenever she approached the bed, 
 while at 
the same period she was affectionate and submissive to a much 
older sister.
 Then there followed a lucid but rather apathetic 
condition, 
 with badly disturbed sleep.
 It was in this phase that 
I began to treat her and to analyse her dreams.
 An enormous 
number of these dealt, 
 in a more or less veiled fashion, 
 with the 
death of the girl’s mother ;
 now she was present at the funeral of 
an old woman, 
 now she saw herself and her sister sitting at a 
table, 
 dressed in mourning;
 the meaning of the dreams could 
not be doubted.
 During her progressive improvement hysterical 
phobias made their appearance, 
 the most distressing of which 
was the fear that something had happened to her mother.
 Wherever she might be at the time, 
 she had then to hurry home in 
order to convince herself that her mother was still alive.
 Now 
this case, 
 considered in conjunction with the rest of my experience, 
 was very instructive;
 it showed, 
 in polyglot translations, 
 
as it were, 
 the different ways in which the psychic apparatus 
reacts to the same exciting idea.
 In the state of confusion, 
 which 
I regard as an overthrow of the second psychic instance by the 
first instance, 
 at other times suppressed, 
 the unconscious enmity 
towards the mother gained the upper hand, 
 and found physical 
expression;
 then, 
 when the patient became calmer, 
 the insurrection was suppressed, 
 and the domination of the censorship restored, 
 and this enmity had access only to the realms of dreams, 
 
in which it realized the wish that the mother might die;
 and 
after the normal condition had been still further strengthened it 
created the excessive concern for the mother as a hysterical 
counter-reaction and defensive phenomenon.
 In the light of 
these considerations, 
 it is no longer inexplicable why hysterical 
girls are so often extravagantly attached to their mothers.
 

On another occasion I had an opportunity of obtaining a profound 
insight into the unconscious psychic life of a young man 
for whom an obsessional neurosis made life almost unendurable, 
 
so that he could not go into the streets, 
 because he was tormented by the fear that he would kill everyone he met.
 He spent 
his days in contriving evidence of an alibi in case he should be 
accused of any murder that might have been committed in the 
city.
 It goes without saying that this man was as moral as he 
was highly cultured.
 The analysis — which, 
 by the way, 
 led to a 
cure — revealed, 
 as the basis of this distressing obsession, 
 murderous impulses in respect of his rather overstrict father — impulses which, 
 to his astonishment, 
 had consciously expressed 
themselves when he was seven years old, 
 but which, 
 of course, 
 
had originated in a much earlier period of his childhood.
 After 
the painful illness and death of his father, 
 when the young man 
was in his thirty-first year, 
 the obsessive reproach made its appearance, 
 which transferred itself to strangers in the form of 
this phobia.
 Anyone capable of wishing to push his own father 
from a mountain-top into an abyss cannot be trusted to spare 
the lives of persons less closely related to him;
 he therefore does 
well to lock himself into his room.
 

According to my already extensive experience, 
 parents play 
a leading part in the infantile psychology of all persons who 
subsequently become psychoneurotics.
 Falling in love with one 
parent and hating the other forms part of the permanent stock 
of the psychic impulses which arise in early childhood, 
 and are 
of such importance as the material of the subsequent neurosis.
 
But I do not believe that psychoneurotics are to be sharply distinguished in this respect from other persons who remain normal — that is, 
 I do not believe that they are capable of creating 
something absolutely new and peculiar to themselves.
 It is far 
more probable — and this is confirmed by incidental observations of normal children — that in their amorous or hostile attitude toward their parents, 
 psychoneurotics do no more than 
reveal to us, 
 by magnification, 
 something that occurs less markedly and intensively in the minds of the majority of children.
 
Antiquity has furnished us with legendary matter which corroborates this belief, 
 and the profound and universal validity of 
the old legends is explicable only by an equally universal validity 
of the above-mentioned hypothesis of infantile psychology.
 

I am referring to the legend of King Oedipus and the Oedipus 
Rex of Sophocles.
 Oedipus, 
 the son of Laius, 
 king of Thebes, 
 
and Jocasta, 
 is exposed as a suckling, 
 because an oracle had informed the father that his son, 
 who was still unborn, 
 would be 
his murderer.
 He is rescued, 
 and grows up as a king’s son at a 
foreign court, 
 until, 
 being uncertain of his origin, 
 he, 
 too, 
 consults the oracle, 
 and is warned to avoid his native place, 
 for he 
is destined to become the murderer of his father and the husband of his mother.
 On the road leading away from his supposed 
home he meets King Laius, 
 and in a sudden quarrel strikes him 
dead.
 He comes to Thebes, 
 where he solves the riddle of the 
Sphinx, 
 who is barring the way to the city, 
 whereupon he is 
elected king by the grateful Thebans, 
 and is rewarded with the 
hand of Jocasta.
 He reigns for many years in peace and honour, 
 
and begets two sons and two daughters upon his unknown 
mother, 
 until at last a plague breaks out — which causes the 
Thebans to consult the oracle anew.
 Here Sophocles’ tragedy 
begins.
 The messengers bring the reply that the plague will stop 
as soon as the murderer of Laius is driven from the country.
 But 
where is he? 


Where shall be found, 
 

Faint, 
 and hard to be known, 
 the trace of the ancient guilt? 

The action of the play consists simply in the disclosure, 
 approached step by step and artistically delayed (and comparable 
to the work of a psychoanalysis) that Oedipus himself is the 
murderer of Laius, 
 and that he is the son of the murdered man 
and Jocasta.
 Shocked by the abominable crime which he has 
unwittingly committed, 
 Oedipus blinds himself, 
 and departs 
from his native city.
 The prophecy of the oracle has been fulfilled.
 

The Oedipus Rex is a tragedy of fate;
 its tragic effect depends on the conflict between the all-powerful will of the gods 
and the vain efforts of human beings threatened with disaster;
 
resignation to the divine will, 
 and the perception of one’s own 
impotence is the lesson which the deeply moved spectator is 
supposed to learn from the tragedy.
 Modern au th ors have therefore 
sought to achieve a similar tragic effect by expressing the 
same conflict in stories of their own invention.
 But the playgoers have looked on unmoved at the unavailing efforts of guiltless men to avert the fulfilment of curse or oracle;
 the modern 
tragedies of destiny have failed of their effect.
 

If the Oedipus Rex is capable of moving a modem reader or 
playgoer no less powerfully than it moved the contemporary 
Greeks, 
 the only possible explanation is that the effect of the 
Greek tragedy does not depend upon the conflict between fate 
and human will, 
 but upon the peculiar nature of the material by 
which this conflict is revealed.
 There must be a voice within us 
which is prepared to acknowledge the compelling power of fate 
in the Oedipus, 
 while we are able to condemn the situations occurring in Die Aknfrau or other tragedies of fate as arbitrary 
inventions.
 And there actually is a motive in the story of King 
Oedipus which explains the verdict of this inner voice.
 His fate 
moves us only because it might have been our own, 
 because the 
oracle laid upon us before our birth the very curse which rested 
upon him.
 It may be that we were all destined to direct our first 
sexual impulses toward our mothers, 
 and our first impulses of 
hatred and violence toward our fathers;
 our dreams convince us 
that we were.
 King Oedipus, 
 who slew his father Laius and 
wedded his mother Jocasta, 
 is nothing more or less than a wishfulfilment — the fulfilment of the wish of our childhood.
 But we, 
 
more fortunate than he, 
 in so far as we have not become psychoneurotics, 
 have since our childhood succeeded in withdrawing 
our sexual impulses from our mothers, 
 and in forgetting our 
jealousy of our fathers.
 We recoil from the person for whom this 
primitive wish of our childhood has been fulfilled with all the 
force of the repression which these wishes have undergone in 
our minds since childhood.
 As the poet brings the guilt of 
Oedipus to light by his investigation, 
 he forces us to become 
aware of our own inner selves, 
 in which the same impulses are 
still extant, 
 even though they are suppressed.
 The antithesis 
with which the chorus departs: — 

.
 .
 Behold, 
 this is Oedipus, 
 

Who unravelled the great riddle, 
 and was first in power, 
 

Whose fortune all the townsmen praised and envied;
 

See in what dread adversity he sank! 

— this admonition touches us and our own pride, 
 us who since 
the years of our childhood have grown so wise and so powerful 
in our own estimation.
 Like Oedipus, 
 we live in ignorance of the 
desires that offend morality, 
 the desires that nature has forced 
upon us and after their unveiling we may well prefer to avert our 
gaze from the scenes of our childhood .
 51 

In the very text of Sophocles’ tragedy there is an unmistakable reference to the fact that the Oedipus legend had its source 
in dream-material of immemorial antiquity, 
 the content of which 
was the painful disturbance of the child’s relations to its parents 
caused by the first impulses of sexuality.
 Jocasta comforts Oedipus — who is not yet enlightened, 
 but is troubled by the recollection of the oracle — by an allusion to a dream which is often 
dreamed, 
 though it cannot, 
 in her opinion, 
 mean anything: — 

For many a man hath seen himself in dreams 
His mother’s mate, 
 but he who gives no heed 
To suchlike matters bears the easier life.
 

The dream of having sexual intercourse with one’s mother was 
as common then as it is to-day with many people, 
 who tell it 
with indignation and astonishment.
 As may well be imagined, 
 it 
is the key to the tragedy and the complement to the dream of the 
death of the father.
 The Oedipus fable is the reaction of phantasy 
to these two typical dreams, 
 and just as such a dream, 
 when 
occurring to an adult, 
 is experienced with feelings of aversion, 
 
so the content of the fable must include terror and self-chastisement.
 The form which it subsequently assumed was the result 
of an uncomprehending secondary elaboration of the material, 
 
which sought to make it serve a theological intention .
 52 The attempt to reconcile divine omnipotence with human responsibility 
must, 
 of course, 
 fail with this material as with any other.
 

Another of the great poetic tragedies, 
 Shakespeare’s Hamlet, 
 
is rooted in the same soil as Oedipus Rex.
 But the whole difference in the psychic life of the two widely separated periods of 
civilization, 
 and the progress, 
 during the course of time, 
 of repression in the emotional life of humanity, 
 is manifested in the 
differing treatment of the same material.
 In Oedipus Rex the 
basic wish-phantasy of the child is brought to light and realized 
as it is in dreams;
 in Hamlet it remains repressed, 
 and we learn 
of its existence — as we discover the relevant facts in a neurosis — only through the inhibitory effects which proceed from it.
 In the 
more modern drama, 
 the curious fact that it is possible to remain 
in complete uncertainty as to the character of the hero has 
proved to be quite consistent with the overpowering effect of the 
tragedy.
 The play is based upon Hamlet’s hesitation in accomplishing the task of revenge assigned to him;
 the text does not 
give the cause or the motive of this hesitation, 
 nor have the 
manifold attempts at interpretation succeeded in doing so.
 According to the still prevailing conception, 
 a conception for which 
Goethe was first responsible, 
 Hamlet represents the type of man 
whose active energy is paralysed by excessive intellectual activity: Sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.
 According to 
another conception, 
 the poet has endeavoured to portray a 
morbid, 
 irresolute character, 
 on the verge of neurasthenia.
 The 
plot of the drama, 
 however, 
 shows us that Hamlet is by no means 
intended to appear as a character wholly incapable of action.
 On 
two separate occasions we see him assert himself: once in a 
sudden outburst of rage, 
 when he stabs the eavesdropper behind 
the arras, 
 and on the other occasion when he deliberately, 
 and 
even craftily, 
 with the complete unscrupulousness of a prince of 
the Renaissance, 
 sends the two courtiers to the death which was 
intended for himself.
 What is it, 
 then, 
 that inhibits him in accomplishing the task which his father’s ghost has laid upon him? 
Here the explanation offers itself that it is the peculiar nature of 
this task.
 Hamlet is able to do anything but take vengeance 
62 Cf.
 the dream-material of exhibitionism, 
 p.
 141.
 

upon the man who did away with his father and has taken his 
father’s place with his mother — the man who shows him in 
realization the repressed desires of his own childhood.
 The loathing which should have driven him to revenge is thus replaced 
by self-reproach, 
 by conscientious scruples, 
 which tell him that 
he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is required to 
punish.
 I have here translated into consciousness what had to 
remain unconscious in the mind of the hero ;
 if anyone wishes to 
call Hamlet an hysterical subject I cannot but admit that this 
is the deduction to be drawn from my interpretation.
 The sexual 
aversion which Hamlet expresses in conversation with Ophelia is 
perfectly consistent with this deduction — the same sexual aversion which during the next few years was increasingly to take 
possession of the poet’s soul, 
 until it found its supreme utterance 
in Thnon of Athens .
 It can, 
 of course, 
 be only the poet’s own 
psychology with which we are confronted in Hamlet;
 and in a 
work on Shakespeare by Georg Brandes (1896) I find the statement that the drama was composed immediately after the death 
of Shakespeare’s father (1601) — that is to say, 
 when he was still 
mourning his loss, 
 and during a revival, 
 as we may fairly assume, 
 
of his own childish feelings in respect of his father.
 It is known, 
 
too, 
 that Shakespeare’s son, 
 who died in childhood, 
 bore the 
name of Hamnet (identical with Hamlet) .
 Just as Hamlet treats 
of the relation of the son to his parents, 
 so Macbeth , 
 which was 
written about the same period, 
 is based upon the theme of 
childlessness.
 Just as all neurotic symptoms, 
 like dreams themselves, 
 are capable of hyper- interpretation, 
 and even require 
such hyper-interpretation before they become perfectly intelligible, 
 so every genuine poetical creation must have proceeded 
from more than one motive, 
 more than one impulse in the mind 
of the poet, 
 and must admit of more than one interpretation.
 I 
have here attempted to interpret only the deepest stratum of 
impulses in the mind of the creative poet.
 53 

With regard to typical dreams of the death of relatives, 
 I 
must add a few words upon their significance from the point of 
view of the theory of dreams in general.
 These dreams show us 
the occurence of a very unusual state of things;
 they show us 
that the dream-thought created by the repressed wish completely escapes the censorship, 
 and is transferred to the dream 
without alteration.
 Special conditions must obtain in order to 
make this possible.
 The following two factors favour the production of these dreams: first, 
 this is the last wish that we could 
credit ourselves with harbouring;
 we believe such a wish would 
never occur to us even in a dream;
 the dream-censorship is 
therefore unprepared for this monstrosity, 
 just as the laws of 
Solon did not foresee the necessity of establishing a penalty for 
patricide.
 Secondly, 
 the repressed and unsuspected wish is, 
 in 
this special case, 
 frequently met half-way by a residue from 
the day’s experience, 
 in the form of some concern for the life of 
the beloved person.
 This anxiety cannot enter into the dream 
otherwise than by taking advantage of the corresponding wish;
 
but the wish is able to mask itself behind the concern which has 
been aroused during the day.
 If one is inclined to think that all 
this is really a very much simpler process, 
 and to imagine that 
one merely continues during the night, 
 and in one’s dream, 
 what 
was begun during the day, 
 one removes the dreams of the death 
of those dear to us out of all connection with the general explanation of dreams, 
 and a problem that may very well be 
solved remains a problem needlessly.
 

It is instructive to trace the relation of these dreams to 
anxiety-dreams.
 In dreams of the death of those dear to us the 
repressed wish has found a way of avoiding the censorship — and 
the distortion for which the censorship is responsible.
 An invariable concomitant phenomenon, 
 then, 
 is that painful emotions 
are felt in the dream.
 Similarly, 
 an anxiety-dream occurs only 
when the censorship is entirely or partially overpowered, 
 and 
on the other hand, 
 the overpowering of the censorship is facilitated when the actual sensation of anxiety is already present 
from somatic sources.
 It thus becomes obvious for what purpose 
the censorship performs its office and practices dream-distortion;
 
it does so in order to prevent the development of anxiety or 
other forms of painful affect .
 

I have spoken in the foregoing sections of the egoism of the 
child’s psyche, 
 and I now emphasize this peculiarity in order to 
suggest a connection, 
 for dreams too have retained this characteristic.
 All dreams are absolutely egoistical;
 in every dream the 
beloved ego appears, 
 even though in a disguised form.
 The wishes 
that are realized in dreams are invariably the wishes of this ego;
 
it is only a deceptive appearance if interest in another person 
is believed to have evoked a dream.
 I will now analyse a few 
examples which appear to contradict this assertion.
 

I 

A boy not yet four years of age relates the following dream: 
He saw a large garnished dish, 
 on which was a large joint of roast 
meat;
 and the joint was suddenly — not carved — but eaten up.
 
He did not see the person who ate it , 
 54 
Who can he be, 
 this strange person, 
 of whose luxurious repast 
the little fellow dreams? The experience of the day must supply 
the answer.
 For some days past the boy, 
 in accordance with the 
doctor’s orders, 
 had been living on a milk diet;
 but on the evening of the dream-day he had been naughty, 
 and, 
 as a punishment, 
 had been deprived of his supper.
 He had already undergone one such hunger-cure, 
 and had borne his deprivation 
bravely.
 He knew that he would get nothing, 
 but he did not 
even allude to the fact that he was hungry.
 Training was beginning to produce its effect;
 this is demonstrated even by the 
dream, 
 which reveals the beginnings of dream-distortion.
 There 
is no doubt that he himself is the person whose desires are 
directed toward this abundant meal, 
 and a meal of roast meat 
at that.
 But since he knows that this is forbidden him, 
 he does 
not dare, 
 as hungry children do in dreams (cf.
 my little Anna’s 
dream about strawberries, 
 p.
 40), 
 to sit down to the meal himself.
 The person remains anonymous.
 

II 

One night I dream that I see on a bookseller’s counter a new 
volume of one of those collectors’ series, 
 which I am in the habit 
of buying (monographs on artistic subjects, 
 history, 
 famous 
artistic centres, 
 etc.
).
 The new collection is entitled Famous 
Orators {or Orations ), 
 and the first number bears the name of 
Dr .
 Lecher.
 

On analysis it seems to me improbable that the fame of Dr.
 
Lecher, 
 the long-winded speaker of the German Opposition, 
 
should occupy my thoughts while I am dreaming.
 The fact is 
that a few days ago I undertook the psychological treatment of 
some new patients, 
 and am now forced to talk for ten to twelve 
hours a day.
 Thus I myself am a long-winded speaker.
 

III 

On another occasion I dream that a university lecturer of my 
acquaintance says to me: My son , 
 the myopic Then follows 
a dialogue of brief observations and replies.
 A third portion of 
the dream follows, 
 in which I and my sons appear, 
 and so far as 
the latent dream-content is concerned, 
 the father, 
 the son, 
 and 
Professor M.
, 
 are merely lay figures, 
 representing myself and 
my eldest son.
 Later on I shall examine this dream again, 
 on 
account of another peculiarity.
 

IV 

The following dream gives an example of really base, 
 egoistical 
feelings, 
 which conceal themselves behind an affectionate concern: 

My friend Otto looks Ul;
 his face is brown and his eyes pro trude.
 

Otto is my family physician, 
 to whom I owe a debt greater 
than I can ever hope to repay, 
 since he has watched for years 
over the health of my children, 
 has treated them successfully 
when they have been ill, 
 and, 
 moreover, 
 has given them presents 
whenever he could find any excuse for doing so.
 He paid us a 
visit on the day of the dream, 
 and my wife noticed that he 
looked tired and exhausted.
 At night I dream of him, 
 and my 
dream attributes to him certain of the symptoms of Basedow’s 
disease.
 If you were to disregard my rules for dream-interpretation you would understand this dream to mean that I am concerned about the health of my friend, 
 and that this concern is 
realized in the dream.
 It would thus constitute a contradiction 
not only of the assertion that a dream is a wish-fulfilment, 
 but 
also of the assertion that it is accessible only to egoistical impulses.
 But will those who thus interpret my dream explain why 
I should fear that Otto has Basedow’s disease, 
 for which diagnosis his appearance does not afford the slightest justification? 
My analysis, 
 on the other hand, 
 furnishes the following material, 
 
deriving from an incident which had occurred six years earlier.
 
We were driving— a small party of us, 
 including Professor R.
 — 
in the dark through the forest of N.
, 
 which lies at a distance of 
some hours from where we were staying in the country.
 The 
driver, 
 who was not quite sober, 
 overthrew us and the carriage 
down a bank, 
 and it was only by good fortune that we all escaped unhurt.
 But we were forced to spend the night at the 
nearest inn, 
 where the news of our mishap aroused great sympathy.
 A certain gentleman, 
 who showed unmistakable symptoms of morbus Basedowii — the brownish colour of the skin of 
the face and the protruding eyes, 
 but no goitre— placed himself 
entirely at our disposal, 
 and asked what he could do for us.
 

Professor R.
 answered in his decisive way, 
 Nothing, 
 except lend 
me a nightshirt.
 Whereupon our generous friend replied: I 
am sorry, 
 but I cannot do that, 
 and left us.
 

In continuing the analysis, 
 it occurs to me that Basedow is 
the name not only of a physician, 
 but also of a famous pedagogue.
 
(Now that I am wide awake, 
 I do not feel quite sure of this 
fact.
) My friend Otto is the person whom I have asked to take 
charge of the physical education of my children — especially 
during the age of puberty (hence the nightshirt) in case anything 
should happen to me.
 By seeing Otto in my dream with the 
morbid symptoms of our above-mentioned generous helper, 
 I 
dearly mean to say: If anything happens to me, 
 he will do just 
as little for my children as Baron L.
 did for us, 
 in spite of his 
amiable offers.
 The egoistical flavour of this dream should now 
be obvious enough .
 55 

But where is the wish-fulfilment to be found in this? Not in 
the vengeance wreaked on my friend Otto (who seems to be fated 
to be badly treated in my dreams) , 
 but in the following circumstance: Inasmuch as in my dream I represented Otto as Baron 
L.
, 
 I likewise identified myself with another person, 
 namely, 
 
with Professor R.
;
 for I have asked something of Otto, 
 just as 
R.
 asked something of Baron L.
 at the time of the incident I 
have described.
 And this is the point.
 For Professor R.
 has gone 
his way independently, 
 outside academic circles, 
 just as I myself 
have done, 
 and has only in his later years received the title 
which he had earned long before.
 Once more, 
 then, 
 I want to be 
a professor 1 The very phrase in his later years is a wishfulfilment, 
 for it means that I shall live long enough to steer my 
boys through the age of puberty myself.
 

Of other typical dreams, 
 in which one flies with a feeling of ease 
or falls in terror, 
 I know nothing from my own experience, 
 and 
whatever I have to say about them I owe to my psychoanalyses.
 
From the information thus obtained one must conclude that 
these dreams also reproduce impressions made in childhood — 
that is, 
 that they refer to the games involving rapid motion 
which have such an extraordinary attraction for children.
 Where 
is the uncle who has never made a child fly by running with it 
across the room with outstretched arms, 
 or has never played at 
falling with it by rocking it on his knee and then suddenly 
straightening his leg, 
 or by lifting it above his head and suddenly 
pretending to withdraw his supporting hand? At such moments 
children shout with joy, 
 and insatiably demand a repetition of 
the performance, 
 especially if a little fright and dizziness are 
involved in the game;
 in after years they repeat their sensations 
in dreams, 
 but in dreams they omit the hands that held them, 
 so 
that now they are free to float or fall.
 We know that all small 
children have a fondness for such games as rocking and seesawing;
 and if they see gymnastic performances at the circus 
their recollection of such games is refreshed.
 58 In some boys a 
hysterical attack will consist simply in the reproduction of such 
performances, 
 which they accomplish with great dexterity.
 Not 
infrequently sexual sensations are excited by these games of 
movement, 
 which are quite neutral in themselves.
 57 To express 


Psychoanalytic investigation has enabled ns to conclude that in the predilection shown by children for gymnastic performances, 
 and in the repetition of these in hysterical attacks, 
 there is, 
 besides the pleasure felt in the 
organ, 
 yet another factor at work (often unconscious) : namely, 
 a memorypicture of sexual intercourse observed in human beings or animals.
 

A young coUeague, 
 who is entirely free from nervousness, 
 tells me, 
 in this 
connection: I know from my own experience that while swinging, 
 and at 
the moment at which the downward movement was at its j use d 

to have a curious feeling in my genitals, 
 which, 
 although it was not really 
pleasing to me, 
 I must describe as a voluptuous feeling.
 I have often heard 
the matter in a few words: the exciting games of childhood are 
repeated in dreams of flying, 
 falling, 
 reeling and the like, 
 but the 
voluptuous feelings are now transformed into anxiety.
 But, 
 as 
every mother knows, 
 the excited play of children often enough 
culminates in quarrelling and tears.
 

I have therefore good reason for rejecting the explanation that 
it is the state of our dermal sensations during sleep, 
 the sensation 
of the movements of the lungs, 
 etc.
, 
 that evokes dreams of flying 
and falling.
 I see that these very sensations have been reproduced from the memory to which the dream refers — and that 
they are, 
 therefore, 
 dream-content and not dream-sources.
 

I do not for a moment deny, 
 however, 
 that I am unable to 
furnish a full explanation of this series of typical dreams.
 Precisely here my material leaves me in the lurch.
 I must adhere to 
the general opinion that all the dermal and kinetic sensations of 
these typical dreams are awakened as soon as any psychic motive of whatever kind has need of them, 
 and that they are neglected when there is no such need of them.
 The relation to infantile 
experiences seems to be confirmed by the indications which I 
have obtained from the analyses of psychoneurotics.
 But I am 
unable to say what other meanings might, 
 in the course of the 
dreamer’s life, 
 have become attached to the memory of these 
sensations — different, 
 perhaps, 
 in each individual, 
 despite the 
typical appearance of these dreams — and I should very much 
like to be in a position to fill this gap with careful analyses of 
good examples.
 To those who wonder why I complain of a lack 
of material, 
 despite the frequency of these dreams of flying, 
 falling, 
 tooth-drawing, 
 etc.
, 
 I must explain that I myself have never 
experienced any such dreams since I have turned my attention 
to the subject of dream-interpretation.
 The dreams of neurotics 
which are at my disposal, 
 however, 
 are not all capable of interpretation, 
 and very often it is impossible to penetrate to the 
farthest point of their hidden intention;
 a certain psychic force 
which participated in the building up of the neurosis, 
 and which 
again becomes active during its dissolution, 
 opposes interpretation of the final problem.
 

( c ) The Examination-Dream 

Everyone who has received his certificate of matriculation after 
passing his final examination at school complains of the persistence with which he is plagued by anxiety-dreams in which he 
has failed, 
 or must go through his course again, 
 etc.
 For the 
holder of a university degree this typical dream is replaced by 
another, 
 which represents that he has not taken his doctor’s degree, 
 to which he vainly objects, 
 while still asleep, 
 that he has 
already been practising for years, 
 or is already a university lecturer or the senior partner of a firm of lawyers, 
 and so on.
 These 
are the ineradicable memories of the punishments we suffered as 
childen for misdeeds which we had committed — memories which 
were revived in us on the dies irae, 
 dies ilia of the gruelling examination at the two critical junctures in our careers as students.
 
The examination-anxiety of neurotics is likewise intensified 
by this childish fear.
 When our student days are over it is no 
longer our parents or teachers who see to our punishment;
 the 
inexorable chain of cause and effect of later life has taken over 
our further education.
 Now we dream of our matriculation, 
 or 
the examination for the doctor’s degree — and who has not been 
faint-hearted on such occasions? — whenever we fear that we 
may be punished by some unpleasant result because we have 
done something carelessly or wrongly, 
 because we have not been 
as thorough as we might have been— in short, 
 whenever we feel 
the burden of responsibility.
 

For a further explanation of examination-dreams I have to 
thank a remark made by a colleague who had studied this subject, 
 who.
 once stated, 
 in the course of a scientific discussion, 
 
that in his experience the examination-dream occurred only to 
persons who had passed the examination, 
 never to those who 
had flunked.
 We have had increasing confirmation of the fact 
that the anxiety-dream of examination occurs when the dreamer 
is anticipating a responsible task on the following day, 
 with the 
possibility of disgrace;
 recourse will then be had to an occasion 
in the past on which a great anxiety proved to have been without 
real justification, 
 having, 
 indeed, 
 been refuted by the outcome.
 
Such a dream would be a very striking example of the way in 
which the dream-content is misunderstood by the waking instance.
 The exclamation which is regarded as a protest against 
the dream: But I am already a doctor, 
 etc.
, 
 would in reality 
be the consolation offered by the dream, 
 and should, 
 therefore, 
 
be worded as follows: Do not be afraid of the morrow;
 think 
of the anxiety which you felt before your matriculation;
 yet 
nothing happened to justify it, 
 for now you are a doctor, 
 etc.
 
But the anxiety which we attribute to the dream really has its 
origin in the residues of the dream-day.
 

The tests of this interpretation which I have been able to make 
in my own case, 
 and in that of others, 
 although by no means 
exhaustive, 
 were entirely in its favour .
 58 For example, 
 I failed in 
my examination for the doctor’s degree in medical jurisprudence ;
 
never once has the matter worried me in my dreams, 
 while I 
have often enough been examined in botany, 
 zoology, 
 and chemistry, 
 and I sat for the examinations in these subjects with welljustified anxiety, 
 but escaped disaster, 
 through the clemency of 
fate, 
 or of the examiner.
 In my dreams of school examinations 
I am always examined in history, 
 a subject in which I passed 
brilliantly at the time, 
 but only, 
 I must admit, 
 because my goodnatured professor — my one-eyed benefactor in another dream — 
did not overlook the fact that on the examination-paper which 
I returned to him I had crossed out with my fingernail the second 
of three questions, 
 as a hint that he should not insist on it.
 One 
of my patients, 
 who withdrew before the matriculation examination, 
 only to pass it later, 
 but failed in the officer’s examination, 
 
so that he did not become an officer, 
 tells me that he often dreams 
of the former examination, 
 but never of the latter.
 

W.
 Stekel, 
 who was the first to interpret the matriculation 
dream, 
 maintains that this dream invariably refers to sexual 
experiences and sexual maturity.
 This has frequently been confirmed in my experience.

VI 


THE DREAM-WORK 


All other previous attempts to solve the problems of dreams 
have concerned themselves directly with the manifest dreamcontent as it is retained in the memory.
 They have sought to 
obtain an interpretation of the dream from this content, 
 or, 
 if 
they dispensed with an interpretation, 
 to base their conclusions 
concerning the dream on the evidence provided by this content.
 
We, 
 however, 
 are confronted by a different set of data;
 for us a 
new psychic material interposes itself between the dream-content 
and the results of our investigations: the latent dream-content, 
 
or dream-thoughts, 
 which are obtained only by our method.
 We 
develop the solution of the dream from this latent content, 
 and 
not from the manifest dream-content.
 We are thus confronted 
with a new problem, 
 an entirely novel task — that of examining 
and tracing the relations between the latent dream-thoughts and 
the manifest dream-content, 
 and the processes by which the 
latter has grown out of the former.
 

The dream-thoughts and the dream-content present themselves as two descriptions of the same content in two different 
languages;
 or, 
 to put it more clearly, 
 the dream-content appears 
to us as a translation of the dream-thoughts into another mode 
of expression, 
 whose symbols and laws of composition we must 
learn by comparing the origin with the translation.
 The dreamthoughts we can understand without further trouble the moment 
we have ascertained them.
 The dream-content is, 
 as it were, 
 
presented in hieroglyphics, 
 whose symbols must be translated, 
 
one by one, 
 into the language of the dream-thoughts.
 It would 
of course be incorrect to attempt to read these symbols in accordance with their values as pictures, 
 instead of in accordance 
with their meaning as symbols.
 For instance, 
 I have before me 
a picture-puzzle (rebus) — a house, 
 upon whose roof there is a 
boat;
 then a single letter;
 then a running figure, 
 whose head has 
been omitted, 
 and so on.
 As a critic I might be tempted to judge 
this composition and its elements to be nonsensical.
 A boat is 
out of place on the roof of a house, 
 and a headless man cannot 
run;
 the man, 
 too, 
 is larger than the house, 
 and if the whole 
thing is meant to represent a landscape the single letters of the 
alphabet have no right in it, 
 since they do not occur in nature.
 
A correct judgment of the picture-puzzle is possible only if I 
make no such objections to the whole and its parts, 
 and if, 
 on 
the contrary, 
 I take the trouble to replace each image by a syllable or word which it may represent by virtue of some allusion 
or relation.
 The words thus put together are no longer meaningless, 
 but might constitute the most beautiful and pregnant 
aphorism.
 Now a dream is such a picture-puzzle, 
 and our predecessors in the art of dream-interpretation have made the mistake of judging the rebus as an artistic composition.
 As such, 
 of 
course, 
 it appears nonsensical and worthless.
 

A.
 CONDENSATION 

The first thing that becomes clear to the investigator when he 
compares the dream-content with the dream-thoughts is that a 
tremendous work of condensation has been accomplished.
 The 
dream is meagre, 
 paltry and laconic in comparison with the 
range and copiousness of the dream-thoughts.
 The dream, 
 when 
written down, 
 fills half a page;
 the analysis, 
 which contains the 
dream-thoughts, 
 requires six, 
 eight, 
 twelve times as much space.
 
The ratio varies with different dreams;
 but in my experience it 
is always of the same order.
 As a rule, 
 the extent of the compression which has been accomplished is under-estimated, 
 owing to 
the fact that the dream-thoughts which have been brought to 
light are believed to be the whole of the material, 
 whereas a 
continuation of the work of interpretation would reveal still further thoughts hidden in the dream.
 We have already found it 
necessary to remark that one can never be really sure that one 
has interpreted a dream completely;
 even if the solution seems 
satisfying and flawless, 
 it is always possible that yet another 
meaning has been manifested by the same dream.
 Thus the 
degree of condensation is — strictly speaking — indeterminable.
 
Exception may be taken — and at first sight the objection seems 
perfectly plausible — to the assertion that the disproportion between dream-content and dream-thoughts justifies the conclusion that a considerable condensation of psychic material occurs 
in the formation of dreams.
 For we often have the feeling that we 
have been dreaming a great deal all night, 
 and have then forgotten most of what we have dreamed.
 The dream which we 
remember on waking would thus appear to be merely a remnant 
of the total dream-work, 
 which would surely equal the dreamthoughts in range if only we could remember it completely.
 To 
a certain extent this is undoubtedly true;
 there is no getting away 
from the fact that a dream is most accurately reproduced if we 
try to remember it immediately after waking, 
 and that the recollection of it becomes more and more defective as the day goes 
on.
 On the other hand, 
 it has to be recognized that the impression 
that we have dreamed a good deal more than we are able to 
reproduce is very often based on an illusion, 
 the origin of which 
we shall explain later on.
 Moreover, 
 the assumption of a condensation in the dream-work is not affected by the possibility of 
forgetting a part of dreams, 
 for it may be demonstrated by the 
multitude of ideas pertaining to those individual parts of the 
dream which do remain in the memory.
 If a large part of the 
dream has really escaped the memory, 
 we are probably deprived 
of access to a new series of dream-thoughts.
 We have no justification for expecting that those portions of the dream which have 
been lost should likewise have referred only to those thoughts 
which we know from the analysis of the portions which have been 
preserved .
 

In view of the very great number of ideas which analysis elicits 
for each individual element of the dream-content, 
 the principal 
doubt in the minds of many readers will be whether it is permissible to count everything that subsequently occurs to the mind 
during analysis as forming part of the dream-thoughts — in other 
words, 
 to assume that all these thoughts have been active in the 
sleeping state, 
 and have taken part in the formation of the dream.
 
Is it not more probable that new combinations of thoughts are 
developed in the course of analysis, 
 which did not participate in 
the formation of the dream? To this objection I can give only a 
conditional reply.
 It is true, 
 of course, 
 that separate combinations of thoughts make their first appearance during the analysis ;
 
but one can convince oneself every time this happens that such 
new combinations have been established only between thoughts 
which have already been connected in other ways in the dreamthoughts;
 the new combinations are, 
 so to speak, 
 corollaries, 
 
short-circuits, 
 which are made possible by the existence of other, 
 
more fundamental modes of connection.
 In respect of the great 
majority of the groups of thoughts revealed by analysis, 
 we are 
obliged to admit that they have already been active in the formation of the dream, 
 for if we work through a succession of such 
thoughts, 
 which at first sight seem to have played no part in the 
formation of the dream, 
 we suddenly come upon a thought which 
occurs in the dream-content, 
 and is indispensable to its interpretation, 
 but which is nevertheless inaccessible except through this 
chain of thoughts.
 The reader may here turn to the dream of the 
botanical monograph, 
 which is obviously the result of an astonishing degree of condensation, 
 even though I have not given the 
complete analysis.
 

But how, 
 then, 
 are we to imagine the psychic condition of the 
sleeper which precedes dreaming? Do all the dream-thoughts 
exist side by side, 
 or do they pursue one another, 
 or are there 
'several simultaneous trains of thought, 
 proceeding from different 
centres, 
 which subsequently meet? I do not think it is necessary 
at this point to form a plastic conception of the psychic condition at the time of dream-formation.
 But let us not forget that 
we are concerned with unconscious thinking, 
 and that the 
process may easily be different from that which we observe in 
ourselves in deliberate contemplation accompanied by consciousness.
 

The fact, 
 however, 
 is irrefutable that dream-formation is based 
on a process of condensation.
 How, 
 then, 
 is this condensation 
effected? 

Now, 
 if we consider that of the dream-thoughts ascertained 
only the most restricted number are represented in the dream by 
means of one of their conceptual elements, 
 we might conclude 
that the condensation is accomplished by means of omission, 
 inasmuch as the dream is not a faithful translation or projection, 
 
point by point, 
 of the dream-thoughts, 
 but a very incomplete 
and defective reproduction of them.
 This view, 
 as we shall soon 
perceive, 
 is a very inadequate one.
 But for the present let us take 
it as a point of departure, 
 and ask ourselves: If only a few of 
the elements of the dream-thoughts make their way into the 
dream-content, 
 what are the conditions that determine their 
selection? 

In order to solve this problem, 
 let us turn our attention to 
those elements of the dream-content which must have fulfilled 
the conditions for which we are looking.
 The most suitable material for this investigation will be a dream to whose formation 
a particularly intense condensation has contributed.
 I select the 
dream, 
 cited on page 73 ff.
, 
 of the botanical monograph.
 

I 

Dream-content: / have written a monograph upon a certain (indeterminate) species of plant .
 The book lies before me, 
 I am just 
turning over a folded coloured plate.
 A dried specimen of the 
plant is bound up in this copy , 
 as in a herbarium .
 

The most prominent element of this dream is the botanical 
monograph .
 This is derived from the impressions of the dreamday;
 I had actually seen a monograph on the genus Cyclamen 
in a bookseller’s window.
 The mention of this genus is lacking in 
the dream-content;
 only the monograph and its relation to 
botany have remained.
 The botanical monograph immediately 
reveals its relation to the work on cocaine which I once wrote;
 
from cocaine the train of thought proceeds on the one hand to a 
Festschrift , 
 and on the other to my friend, 
 the oculist, 
 Dr.
 
Koenigstein, 
 who was partly responsible for the introduction of 
cocaine as a local anaesthetic.
 Moreover, 
 Dr.
 Koenigstein is connected with the recollection of an interrupted conversation I had 
had with him on the previous evening, 
 and with all sorts of ideas 
relating to the remuneration of medical and surgical services 
among colleagues.
 This conversation, 
 then, 
 is the actual dreamstimulus;
 the monograph on cyclamen is also a real incident, 
 but 
one of an indifferent nature;
 as I now see, 
 the botanical monograph of the dream proves to be a common mean between the 
two experiences of the day, 
 taken over unchanged from an indifferent impression, 
 and bound up with the psychically significant 
experience by means of the most copious associations.
 

Not only the combined idea of the botanical monograph , 
 however, 
 but also each of its separate elements, 
  botanical  and 
monograph penetrates farther and farther, 
 by manifold associations, 
 into the confused tangle of the dream-thoughts.
 To 
botanical belong the recollections of the person of Professor 
Gartner (German: Gartner = gardener), 
 of his blooming wife, 
 
of my patient, 
 whose name is Flora , 
 and of a lady concerning 
whom I told the story of the forgotten flowers .
 Gartner , 
 again, 
 
leads me to the laboratory and the conversation with Koenigstein;
 and the allusion to the two female patients belongs to the 
same conversation.
 From the lady with the flowers a train of 
thoughts branches off to the favourite flowers of my wife, 
 whose 
other branch leads to the title of the hastily seen monograph.
 
Further, 
 botanical recalls an episode at the Gymnasium, 
 and a 
university examination;
 and a fresh subject — that of my hobbies 
— which was broached in the above-mentioned conversation, 
 is 
linked up, 
 by means of what is humorously called my favourite 
flower , 
 the artichoke, 
 with the train of thoughts proceeding from 
the forgotten flowers;
 behind artichoke there lies, 
 on the one 
hand, 
 a recollection of Italy, 
 and on the other a reminiscence of a 
scene of my childhood, 
 in which I first formed an acquaintance — 
which has since then grown so intimate — with books.
 Botanical, 
 
then, 
 is a veritable nucleus, 
 and, 
 for the dream, 
 the meeting-point 
of many trains of thought;
 which, 
 I can testify, 
 had all really 
been brought into connection by the conversation referred to.
 
Here we find ourselves in a thought-factory, 
 in which, 
 as in The 
Weaver’s Masterpiece : — 

The little shuttles to and fro 

Fly, 
 and the threads unnoted flow;
 

One throw links up a thousand threads.
 

Monograph in the dream, 
 again, 
 touches two themes: the onesided nature of my studies, 
 and the costliness of my hobbies.
 

The impression derived from this first investigation is that 
the elements botanical and monograph were taken up into 
the dream-content because they were able to offer the most 
numerous points of contact with the greatest number of dreamthoughts, 
 and thus represented nodal points at which a great 
number of the dream-thoughts met together, 
 and because they 
were of manifold significance in respect of the meaning of the 
dream.
 The fact upon which this explanation is based may be 
expressed in another form: Every element of the dream-content 
proves to be over-determined — that is, 
 it appears several times 
over in the dream-thoughts.
 

We shall learn more if we examine the other components of 
the dream in respect of their occurrence in the dream-thoughts.
 
The coloured plate refers (cf.
 the analysis on p.
 74) to a new 
subject, 
 the criticism passed upon my work by colleagues, 
 and 
also to a subject already represented in the dream — my hobbies 
— and, 
 further, 
 to a memory of my childhood, 
 in which I pull to 
pieces a book with coloured plates;
 the dried specimen of the 
plant relates to my experience with the herbarium at the Gymnasium, 
 and gives this memory particular emphasis.
 Thus I 
perceive the nature of the relation between the dream-content 
and dream-thoughts: Not only are the elements of the dream 
determined several times over by the dream-thoughts, 
 but the 
individual dream-thoughts are represented in the dream by several elements.
 Starting from an element of the dream, 
 the path 
of the association leads to a number of dream-thoughts;
 and 
from a single dream-thought to several elements of the dream.
 
In the process of dream-formation, 
 therefore, 
 it is not the case 
that a single dream-thought, 
 or a group of dream- thoughts, 
 supplies 
the dream-content with an abbreviation of itself as its representative, 
 and that the next dream-thought supplies another 
abbreviation as its representative (much as representatives are 
elected from among the population) ;
 but rather that the whole 
mass of the dream-thoughts is subjected to a certain elaboration, 
 
in the course of which those elements that receive the strongest 
and completest support stand out in relief;
 so that the process 
might perhaps be likened to election by the scrutin du liste.
 
Whatever dream I may subject to such a dissection, 
 I always 
find the same fundamental principle confirmed — that the dreamelements have been formed out of the whole mass of the dreamthoughts, 
 and that every one of them appears, 
 in relation to the 
dream-thoughts, 
 to have a multiple determination.
 

It is certainly not superfluous to demonstrate this relation of 
the dream-content to the dream-thoughts by means of a further 
example, 
 which is distinguished by a particularly artful intertwining of reciprocal relations.
 The dream is that of a patient 
whom I am treating for claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces).
 
It will soon become evident why I feel myself called upon to 
entitle this exceptionally clever piece of dream-activity: 

II.
 A Beautiful Dream 

The dreamer is driving with a great number of companions in 
X-street, 
 where there is a modest hostelry (which is not the 
case).
 A theatrical performance is being given in one of the 
rooms of the inn .
 He is first spectator, 
 then actor .
 Finally the 
company are told to change their clothes, 
 in order to return to 
the city .
 Some of the company are shown into rooms on the 
ground floor, 
 others to rooms on the first floor .
 Then a dispute 
arises .
 The people upstairs are annoyed because those downstairs 
have not yet finished changing , 
 so that they cannot come down .
 
His brother is upstairs;
 he is downstairs;
 and he is angry with 
his brother because they are so hurried.
 (This part obscure.
) 
Besides, 
 it was already decided, 
 upon their arrival, 
 who was to 
go upstairs and who down .
 Then he goes alone up the hill towards 
the city, 
 and he walks so heavily, 
 and with such difficulty, 
 that 
he cannot move from the spot .
 An elderly gentleman joins him 
and talks angrily of the King of Italy .
 Finally , 
 towards the top 
of the hill , 
 he is able to walk muck more easily.
 

The difficulty experienced in climbing the hill was so distinct 
that for some time after waking he was in doubt whether the 
experience was a dream or the reality.
 

Judged by the manifest content, 
 this dream can hardly be 
eulogized.
 Contrary to the rules, 
 I shall begin the interpretation 
with that portion to which the dreamer referred as being the 
most distinct.
 

The difficulty dreamed of, 
 and probably experienced during 
the dream — difficulty in climbing, 
 accompanied by dyspnoea — 
was one of the symptoms which the patient had actually exhibited some years before, 
 and which, 
 in conjunction with other 
symptoms, 
 was at the time attributed to tuberculosis (probably 
hysterically simulated).
 From our study of exhibition-dreams 
we are already acquainted with this sensation of being inhibited 
in motion, 
 peculiar to dreams, 
 and here again we find it utilized 
as material always available for the purposes of any other kind 
of representation.
 The part of the dream-content which represents climbing as difficult at first, 
 and easier at the top of the 
hill, 
 made me think, 
 while it was being related, 
 of the well-known 
masterly introduction to Daudet’s Sappho.
 Here a young man 
carries the woman he loves upstairs;
 she is at first as light as a 
feather, 
 but the higher he climbs the more she weighs;
 and this 
scene is symbolic of the progress of their relation, 
 in describing 
which Daudet seeks to admonish young men not to lavish an 
earnest affection upon girls of humble origin and dubious antecedents .
 2 Although I knew that my patient had recently had a 
love-affair with an actress, 
 and had broken it off, 
 I hardly expected to find that the inteipretation which had occurred to me 
was correct.
 The situation in Sappho is actually the reverse of 
that in the dream;
 for in the dream climbing was difficult at the 
first and easy later on ;
 in the novel the symbolism is pertinent 
only if what was at first easily carried finally proves to be a 
heavy burden.
 To my astonishment, 
 the patient remarked that 
the interpretation fitted in very well with the plot of a play 
which he had seen the previous evening.
 The play was called 
Rund um Wien (Round about Vienna), 
 and treated of the 
career of a girl who was at first respectable, 
 but who subsequently 
lapsed into the demi-monde , 
 and formed relations with highlyplaced lovers, 
 thereby climbing, 
 but finally she went downhill 
faster and faster.
 This play reminded him of another, 
 entitled 
Von Stufe zu Stuje (From Step to Step), 
 the poster advertising which had depicted a flight 0} stairs .
 

To continue the interpretation: The actress with whom he 
had had his most recent and complicated affair had lived in Xstreet.
 There is no inn in this street.
 However, 
 while he was 
spending part of the summer in Vienna for the sake of this lady, 
 
he had lodged (German: abgestiegen = stopped, 
 literally 
stepped off) at a small hotel in the neighbourhood.
 When he was 
leaving the hotel, 
 he said to the cab-driver: I am glad at all 
events that I didn't get any vermin herel (Incidentally, 
 the 
dread of vermin is one of his phobias.
) Whereupon the cabdriver answered: How could anybody stop there! That isn't a 
hotel at all, 
 it's really nothing but a pub l 

The pub immediately reminded him of a quotation: 

Of a wonderful host 
I was lately a guest.
 

But the host in the poem by Uhland is an apple-tree .
 Now a 
second quotation continues the train of thought: 

Faust: {dancing with the young witch ) .
 

A lovely dream once came to me;
 

I then beheld an apple-tree, 
 

And there two fairest apples shone: 

They lured me so, 
 I climbed thereon 

The Fair One: 

Apples have been desired by you, 
 

Since first in Paradise they grew;
 

And I am moved with joy to know 
That such within my garden grow.
 3 

* Translated by Bayard Taylor.
 


X S4 T H E INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS 

There is not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple-tree 
and the apples.
 A beautiful bosom stood high among the charms 
by which the actress had bewitched our dreamer.
 

Judging from the context of the analysis, 
 we had every reason 
to assume that the dream referred to an impression of the 
dreamer's childhood.
 If this is correct, 
 it must have referred to 
the wet-nurse of the dreamer, 
 who is now a man of nearly thirty 
years of age.
 The bosom of the nurse is in reality an inn for the 
child.
 The nurse, 
 as well as Daudet’s Sappho , 
 appears as an 
allusion to his recently abandoned mistress.
 

The (elder) brother of the patient also appears in the dreamcontent;
 he is upstairs , 
 while the dreamer himself is downstairs .
 
This again is an inversion, 
 for the brother, 
 as I happen to know, 
 
has lost his social position, 
 while my patient has retained his.
 
In relating the dream-content, 
 the dreamer avoided saying that 
his brother was upstairs and that he himself was downstairs.
 This 
would have been too obvious an expression, 
 for in Austria we 
say that a man is on the ground floor when he has lost his fortune and social position, 
 just as we say that he has come down.
 
Now the fact that at this point in the dream something is represented as inverted must have a meaning;
 and the inversion must 
apply to some other relation between the dream-thoughts and 
the dream-content.
 There is an indication which suggests how 
this inversion is to be understood.
 It obviously applies to the end 
of the dream, 
 where the circumstances of climbing are the reverse 
of those described in Sappho .
 Now it is evident what inversion 
is meant: In Sappho the man carries the woman who stands in a 
sexual relation to him;
 in the dream-thoughts, 
 conversely, 
 there 
is a reference to a woman carrying a man;
 and, 
 as this could 
occur only in childhood, 
 the reference is once more to the nurse 
who carries the heavy child.
 Thus the final portion of the dream 
succeeds in representing Sappho and the nurse in the same 
allusion.
 

Just as the name Sappho has not been selected by the poet 
without reference to a Lesbian practice, 
 so the portions of the 
dream in which people are busy upstairs and downstairs , 
 above 
and beneath, 
 point to fancies of a sexual content with which 
the dreamer is occupied, 
 and which, 
 as suppressed cravings, 
 are 
not unconnected with his neurosis.
 Dream-interpretation itself 
does not show that these are fancies and not memories of actual 
happenings;
 it only furnishes us with a set of thoughts and 
leaves it to us to determine their actual value.
 In this case real 
and imagined happenings appear at first as of equal value — and 
not only here, 
 but also in the creation of more important psychic 
structures than dreams.
 A large company, 
 as we already know, 
 
signifies a secret.
 The brother is none other than a representative, 
 
drawn into the scenes of childhood by fancying backwards, 
 
of all of the subsequent rivals for women’s favours.
 Through the 
medium of an experience indifferent in itself, 
 the episode of the 
gentleman who talks angrily of the King of Italy refers to the 
intrusion of people of low rank into aristocratic society.
 It is as 
though the warning which Daudet gives to young men were to 
be supplemented by a similar warning applicable to a suckling 
child.

In the two dreams here cited I have shown by italics where 
one of the elements of the dream recurs in the dream-thoughts, 
 
in order to make the multiple relations of the former more obvious.
 Since, 
 however, 
 the analysis of these dreams has not been 
carried to completion, 
 it will probably be worth while to consider a dream with a full analysis, 
 in order to demonstrate the 
manifold determination of the dream-content.
 For this purpose 
I shall select the dream of Irma’s injection (see p.
 17).
 From 
this example we shall readily see that the condensation-work in 
the dream-formation has made use of more means than one.
 

The chief person in the dream-content is my patient Irma, 
 who 
is seen with the features which belong to her in waking life, 
 and 
who therefore, 
 in the first instance, 
 represents herself.
 But her 
attitude, 
 as I examine her at the window, 
 is taken from a recollection of another person, 
 of the lady for whom I should like to 
exchange my patient, 
 as is shown by the dream-thoughts.
 Inasmuch as Irma has a diphtheritic membrane, 
 which recalls my 
anxiety about my eldest daughter, 
 she comes to represent this 
child of mine, 
 behind whom, 
 connected with her by the identity 
of their names, 
 is concealed the person of the patient who died 
from the effects of poison.
 In the further course of the dream the 
significance of Irma’s personality changes (without the alteration of her image as it is seen in the dream) : she becomes one of 
the children whom we examine in the public dispensaries for 
children’s diseases, 
 where my friends display the differences in 
their mental capacities.
 The transition was obviously effected by 
the idea of my little daughter.
 Owing to her unwillingness to 
open her mouth, 
 the same Irma constitutes an allusion to another lady who was once examined by me, 
 and, 
 also in the same 
connection, 
 to my wife.
 Further, 
 in the morbid changes which I 
discover in her throat I have summarized allusions to quite a 
number of other persons.
 

All these people whom I encounter as I follow up the associations suggested by Irma do not appear personally in the 
dream;
 they are concealed behind the dream-person Irma, 
 
who is thus developed into a collective image, 
 which, 
 as might 
be expected, 
 has contradictory features.
 Irma comes to represent 
these other persons, 
 who are discarded in the work of condensation, 
 inasmuch as I allow anything to happen to her which reminds me of these persons, 
 trait by trait.
 

For the purposes of dream-condensation I may construct a 
composite person in yet another fashion, 
 by combining the actual 
features of two or more persons in a single dream-image.
 It is in 
this fashion that the Dr.
 M.
 of my dream was constructed;
 he 
bears the name of Dr.
 M.
, 
 and he speaks and acts as Dr.
 M.
 
does, 
 but his bodily characteristics and his malady belong to 
another person, 
 my eldest brother;
 a single feature, 
 paleness, 
 is 
doubly determined, 
 owing to the fact that it is common to both 
persons.
 Dr.
 R.
, 
 in my dream about my uncle, 
 is a similar composite person.
 Rut here the dream-image is constructed in yet 
another fashion.
 I have not united features peculiar to the one 
person with the features of the other, 
 thereby abridging by certain features the memory-picture of each;
 but I have adopted 
the method employed by Galton in producing family portraits;
 
namely, 
 I have superimposed the two images, 
 so that the common 
features stand out in stronger relief, 
 while those which do 
not coincide neutralize one another and become indistinct.
 In 
the dream of my uncle the fair beard stands out in relief, 
 as an 
emphasized feature, 
 from a physiognomy which belongs to two 
persons, 
 and which is consequently blurred;
 further, 
 in its reference to growing grey the beard contains an allusion to my father 
and to myself.
 

The construction of collective and composite persons is one of 
the principal methods of dream-condensation.
 We shall presently 
have occasion to deal with this in another connection.
 

The notion of dysentery in the dream of Irma’s injection has 
likewise a multiple determination;
 on the one hand, 
 because of 
its paraphasic assonance with diphtheria, 
 and on the other because of its reference to the patient whom I sent to the East, 
 and 
whose hysteria had been wrongly diagnosed.
 

The mention of propyls in the dream proves again to be an 
interesting case of condensation.
 Not propyls but amyls were 
included in the dream-thoughts.
 One might think that here a 
simple displacement had occurred in the course of dream-formation.
 This is in fact the case, 
 but the displacement serves the 
purposes of the condensation, 
 as is shown from the following 
supplementary analysis: If I dwell for a moment upon the word 
propylen (German) its assonance with the word propylaeum 
suggests itself to me.
 But a propylaeum is to be found not only 
in Athens, 
 but also in Munich.
 In the latter city, 
 a year before 
my dream, 
 I had visited a friend who was seriously ill, 
 and the 
reference to him in trimethylamin , 
 which follows closely upon 
propyls , 
 is unmistakable.
 

I pass over the striking circumstance that here, 
 as elsewhere 
in the analysis of dreams, 
 associations of the most widely differing values are employed for making thought-connections as 
though they were equivalent, 
 and I yield to the temptation to 
regard the procedure by which amyls in the dream-thoughts are 
replaced in the dream-content by propyls as a sort of plastic 
process.
 

On the one hand, 
 here is the group of ideas relating to my 
friend Otto, 
 who does not understand me, 
 thinks I am in the 
wrong, 
 and gives me the liqueur that smells of amyls;
 on the 
other hand, 
 there is the group of ideas — connected with the first 
by contrast — relating to my Berlin friend who does understand 
me, 
 who would always think that I was right, 
 and to whom I 
am indebted for so much valuable information concerning the 
chemistry of sexual processes.
 

What elements in the Otto group are to attract my particular 
attention are determined by the recent circumstances which are 
responsible for the dream;
 amyls belong to the element so distinguished, 
 which are predestined to find their way into the 
dream-content.
 The large group of ideas centering upon William 
is actually stimulated by the contrast between William and Otto, 
 
and those elements in it are emphasized which are in tune with 
those already stirred up in the Otto group.
 In the whole of 
this dream I am continually recoiling from somebody who excites 
my displeasure towards another person with whom I can at will 
confront the first;
 trait by trait I appeal to the friend as against 
the enemy.
 Thus amyls in the Otto group awakes recollections 
in the other group, 
 also belonging to the region of chemistry;
 
trimethylamin, 
 which receives support from several quarters, 
 
finds its way into the dream-content.
 Amyls, 
 too, 
 might have 
got into the dream-content unchanged, 
 but it yields to the influence of the William group, 
 inasmuch as out of the whole range 
of recollections covered by this name an element is sought out 
which is able to furnish a double determination for amyls.
 
Propyls is closely associated with amyls;
 from the William group comes Munich with its propylaeum.
 Both groups 
are united in propyls — propylaeum.
 As though by a compromise, 
 this intermediate element then makes its way into the 
dream-content.
 Here a common mean which permits of a multiple determination has been created.
 It thus becomes palpable 
that a multiple determination must facilitate penetration into 
the dream-content.
 For the purpose of this mean-formation a 
displacement of the attention has been unhesitantingly effected 
from what is really intended to something adjacent to it in the 
associations.
 

The study of the dream of Irma J s injection has now enabled 
us to obtain some insight into the process of condensation which 
occurs in the formation of dreams.
 We perceive, 
 as peculiarities 
of the condensing process, 
 a selection of those elements which 
occur several times over in the dream-content, 
 the formation of 
new unities (composite persons, 
 mixed images), 
 and the production of common means.
 The purpose which is served by condensation, 
 and the means by which it is brought about, 
 will be 
investigated when we come to study in all their bearings the psychic processes at work in the formation of dreams.
 Let us for the 
present be content with establishing the fact of dream-condensation as a relation between the dream-thoughts and the dreamcontent which deserves attention.
 

The condensation-work of dreams becomes most palpable 
when it takes words and means as its objects.
 Generally speaking, 
 
words are often treated in dreams as things, 
 and therefore undergo the same combinations as the ideas of things.
 The results of 
such dreams are comical and bizarre word-formations.
 

x.
 A colleague sent an essay of his, 
 in which he had, 
 in my 
opinion, 
 overestimated the value of a recent physiological discovery, 
 and had expressed himself, 
 moreover, 
 in extravagant 
terms.
 On the following night I dreamed a sentence which obviously referred to this essay: That is a truly norekdal style.
 
The solution of this word-formation at first gave me some difficulty;
 it was unquestionably formed as a parody of the superlatives colossal, 
 pyramidal;
 but it was not easy to say 
where it came from.
 At last the monster fell apart into the two 
names Nora and Ekdal, 
 from two well-known plays by Ibsen.
 I 
had previously read a newspaper article on Ibsen by the writer 
whose latest work I was now criticizing in my dream.
 

2.
 One of my female patients dreams that a man with a fair 
beard and a peculiar glittering eye is pointing to a sign-board 
attached to a tree which reads : uclamparia — wet? 

Analysis.
 — The man was rather authoritative-looking, 
 and 
his peculiar glittering eye at once recalled the church of San 
Paolo, 
 near Rome, 
 where she had seen the mosaic portraits of 
the Popes.
 One of the early Popes had a golden eye (this is really 
an optical illusion, 
 to which the guides usually call attention) .
 
Further associations showed that the general physiognomy of 
the man corresponded with her own clergyman (pope), 
 and the 
shape of the fair beard recalled her doctor (myself), 
 while the 
stature of the man in the dream recalled her father.
 All these 
persons stand in the same relation to her;
 they are all guiding 
and directing the course of her life.
 On further questioning, 
 the 
golden eye recalled gold — money — the rather expensive psychoanalytic treatment, 
 which gives her a great deal of concern.
 Gold, 
 
moreover, 
 recalls the gold cure for alcoholism — Herr D.
, 
 whom 
she would have married, 
 if it had not been for his clinging to the 
disgusting alcohol habit — she does not object to anyone's taking 
an occasional drink;
 she herself sometimes drinks beer and 
liqueurs.
 This again brings her back to her visit to San Paolo 
(faori la mura) and its surroundings.
 She remembers that in the 
neighbouring monastery of the Tre Fontane she drank a liqueur 
made of eucalyptus by the Trappist monks of the monastery.
 
She then relates how the monks transformed this malarial and 
swampy region into a dry and wholesome neighbourhood by 
planting numbers of eucalyptus trees.
 The word uclamparia 
then resolves itself into eucalyptus and malarie, 
 and the word wet 
refers to the former swampy nature of the locality.
 Wet also 
suggests dry.
 Dry is actually the name of the man whom she 
would have married but for his over-indulgence in alcohol.
 The 
peculiar name of Dry is of Germanic origin {drei = three) and 
hence, 
 alludes to the monastery of the Three {drei) Fountains.
 
In talking of Mr.
 Dry's habit she used the strong expression: 
He could drink a fountain.
" Mr.
 Dry jocosely refers to his habit 
by saying: You know I must drink because I am always dry 
(referring to his name).
 The eucalyptus refers also to her neurosis, 
 which was at first diagnosed as malaria .
 She went to Italy 
because her attacks of anxiety, 
 which were accompanied by 
marked rigors and shivering, 
 were thought to be of malarial 
origin.
 She bought some eucalyptus oil from the monks, 
 and she 
maintains that it has done her much good.
 

The condensation uclamparia — wet is therefore the point of 
junction for the dream as well as for the neurosis.
 

3* In a rather long and confused dream of my own, 
 the 
apparent nucleus of which is a sea-voyage, 
 it occurs to me that 
the next port is Hearsing, 
 and next after that Fliess.
 The latter 
is the name of my friend in B.
, 
 to which city I have often journeyed.
 
But Hearsing is put together from the names of the places 
in the neighbourhood of Vienna, 
 which so frequently end in 
ing: Hietzing , 
 Liesing, 
 Moedling (the old Medelitz, 
 niece 
delicice my joy;
 that is, 
 my own name, 
 the German for joy 
being Frende ) , 
 and the English hearsay , 
 which points to calumny, 
 
and establishes the relation to the indifferent dream-stimulus 
of the day — a poem in Fliegende Blatter about a slanderous 
dwarf, 
 Sagter Hatergesagt (Saidhe Hashesaid).
 By the combination of the final syllable ing with the name Fliess, 
 Vlissingen 
is obtained, 
 which is a real port through which my brother passes 
when he comes to visit us from England.
 But the English for 
Vlissingen is Flushing, 
 which signifies blushing, 
 and recalls patients suffering from erythrophobia (fear of blushing), 
 whom I 
sometimes treat, 
 and also a recent publication of Bechterew’s, 
 
relating to this neurosis, 
 the reading of which angered me.
 6 

4.
 Upon another occasion I had a dream which consisted of 
two separate parts.
 The first was the vividly remembered word 
Autodidasker: the second was a faithful reproduction in the 
dream-content of a short and harmless fancy which had been 
developed a few days earlier, 
 and which was to the effect that I 
must tell Professor N.
, 
 when I next saw him: The patient about 
whose condition I last consulted you is really suffering from a 
neurosis, 
 just as you suspected.
 So not only must the newlycoined  Autodidasker satisfy the requirement that it should 
contain or represent a compressed meaning, 
 but this meaning 
must have a valid connection with my resolve — repeated 
from waking life — to give Professor N.
 due credit for his diagnosis.
 

Now Autodidasker is easily separated into author (German, 
 
Autor ), 
 autodidact, 
 and Lasker , 
 with whom is associated the 
name Lasalle.
 The first of these words leads to the occasion of 
the dream — which this time is significant.
 I had brought home 
to my wife several volumes by a well-known author who is a 
friend of my brother's, 
 and who, 
 as I have learned, 
 comes from 
the same neighbourhood as myself (J.
 J.
 David).
 One evening 
she told me how profoundly impressed she had been by the 
pathetic sadness of a story in one of David's novels (a story of 
wasted talents), 
 and our conversation turned upon the signs of 
talent which we perceive in our own children.
 Under the influence of what she had just read, 
 my wife expressed some concern 
about our children, 
 and I comforted her with the remark that 
precisely such dangers as she feared can be averted by training.
 
Duing the night my thoughts proceeded farther, 
 took up my 
wife's concern for the children, 
 and interwove with it all sorts of 
other things.
 Something which the novelist had said to my 
brother on the subject of marriage showed my thoughts a bypath which might lead to representation in the dream.
 This path 
led to Breslau;
 a lady who was a very good friend of ours had 
married and gone to live there.
 I found in Breslau Lasker and 
Lasalle, 
 two examples to justify the fear lest our boys should 
be ruined by women, 
 examples which enabled me to represent 
simultaneously two ways of influencing a man to his undoing .
 7 
The Cherchez la jemme, 
 by which these thoughts may be summarized, 
 leads me, 
 if taken in another sense, 
 to my brother, 
 who 
is still unmarried and whose name is Alexander .
 Now I see that 
Alex, 
 as we abbreviate the name, 
 sounds almost like an inversion 
of Lasker , 
 and that this fact must have contributed to send my 
thoughts on a detour by way of Breslau.
 

But the playing with names and syllables in which I am here 
engaged has yet another meaning.
 It represents the wish that my 
brother may enjoy a happy family life, 
 and this in the following 
manner: In the novel of artistic life, 
 L’CEuvre, 
 which, 
 by virtue 
of its content, 
 must have been in association with my dreamthoughts, 
 the author, 
 as is well-known, 
 has incidentally given a 
description of his own person and his own domestic happiness, 
 
and appears under the name of Sandoz .
 In the metamorphosis 
of his name he probably went to work as follows: Zola , 
 when 
inverted (as children are fond of inverting names) gives Aloz .
 
But this was still too undisguised;
 he therefore replaced the 
syllable Al, 
 which stands at the beginning of the name Alexander, 
 by the third syllable of the same name, 
 sand, 
 and thus 
arrived at Sandoz.
 My autodidasker originated in a similar 
fashion.
 

My phantasy — that I am telling Professor N.
 that the patient 
whom we have both seen is suffering from a neurosis — found its 
way into the dream in the following manner: Shortly before the 
close of my working year I had a patient in whose case my 
powers of diagnosis failed me.
 A serious organic trouble — possibly some alterative degeneration of the spinal cord — was to be 
assumed, 
 but could not be conclusively demonstrated.
 It would 
have been tempting to diagnose the trouble as a neurosis, 
 and 
this would have put an end to all my difficulties, 
 but for the fact 
that the sexual anamnesis, 
 failing which I am unwilling to admit 
a neurosis, 
 was so energetically denied by the patient.
 In my 
embarrassment I called to my assistance the physician whom I 
respect most of all men (as others do also), 
 and to whose authority I surrender most completely.
 He listened to my doubts, 
 told 
me he thought them justified, 
 and then said: Keep on observing 
the man, 
 it is probably a neurosis.
 Since I know that he does 
not share my opinions concerning the etiology of the neuroses, 
 
I refrained from contradicting him, 
 but I did not conceal my 
scepticism.
 A few days later I informed the patient that I did 
not know what to do with him, 
 and advised him to go to someone 
else.
 Thereupon, 
 to my great astonishment, 
 he began to beg my 
pardon for having lied to me;
 he had felt so ashamed;
 and now 
he revealed to me just that piece of sexual etiology which I had 
expected, 
 and which I found necessary for assuming the existence 
of a neurosis.
 This was a relief to me, 
 but at the same time a 
humiliation;
 for I had to admit that my consultant, 
 who was not 
disconcerted by the absence of anamnesis, 
 had judged the case 
more correctly.
 I made up my mind to tell him, 
 when next I saw 
him, 
 that he had been right and I had been wrong.
 

This is just what I do in the dream.
 But what sort of a wish 
is fulfilled if I acknowledge that I am mistaken? This is precisely 
my wish;
 I wish to be mistaken as regards my fears — that is to 
say, 
 I wish that my wife, 
 whose fears I have appropriated in my 
dream-thoughts, 
 may prove to be mistaken.
 The subject to 
which the fact of being right or wrong is related in the dream is 
not far removed from that which is really of interest to the 
dream-thoughts.
 We have the same pair of alternatives, 
 of either 
organic or functional impairment caused by a woman, 
 or actually 
by the sexual life — either tabetic paralysis or a neurosis — with 
which latter the nature of Lasalle’s undoing is indirectly connected.
 

In this well-constructed (and on careful analysis quite transparent) dream, 
 Professor N.
 appears not merely on account of 
this analogy, 
 and my wish to be proved mistaken, 
 or the associated references to Breslau and to the family of our married 
friend who lives there, 
 but also on account of the following little 
dialogue which followed our consultation: After he had acquitted 
himself of his professional duties by making the above-mentioned 
suggestion, 
 Dr.
 N.
 proceeded to discuss personal matters.
 How 
many children have you now? — Six.
 — A thoughtful and respectful gesture.
 — Girls, 
 boys? — Three of each.
 They are 
my pride and my riches.
 — Well, 
 you must be careful;
 there is 
no difficulty about the girls, 
 but the boys are a difficulty later 
on as regards their upbringing.
 I replied that until now they 
had been very tractable;
 obviously this prognosis of my boys' 
future pleased me as little as his diagnosis of my patient, 
 whom 
he believed to be suffering only from a neurosis.
 These two impressions, 
 then, 
 are connected by their contiguity, 
 by their being 
successively received;
 and when I incorporate the story of the 
neurosis into the dream, 
 I substitute it for the conversation on 
the subject of upbringing, 
 which is even more closely connected 
with the dream-thoughts, 
 since it touches so closely upon the 
anxiety subsequently expressed by my wife.
 Thus, 
 even my fear 
that N.
 may prove to be right in his remarks on the difficulties 
to be met with in bringing up boys is admitted into the dreamcontent, 
 inasmuch as it is concealed behind the representation 
of my wish that I may be wrong to harbour such apprehensions.
 
The same phantasy serves without alteration to represent both 
the conflicting alternatives.
 

Examination-dreams present the same difficulties to interpretation that I have already described as characteristic of most 
typical dreams.
 The associative material which the dreamer supplies only rarely suffices for interpretation.
 A deeper understanding of such dreams has to be accumulated from a considerable number of examples.
 Not long ago I arrived at a conviction 
that reassurances like But you already are a doctor, 
 and so on, 
 
not only convey a consolation but imply a reproach as well.
 This 
would have run: You are already so old, 
 so far advanced in life, 
 
and yet you still commit such follies, 
 are guilty of such childish 
behaviour.
 This mixture of self-criticism and consolation would 
correspond with the examination-dreams.
 After this it is no 
longer surprising that the reproaches in the last analysed examples concerning follies and childish behaviour should 
relate to repetitions of reprehensible sexual acts.
 

The verbal transformations in dreams are very similar to those 
which are known to occur in paranoia, 
 and which are observed 
also in hysteria and obsessions.
 The linguistic tricks of children, 
 
who at a certain age actually treat words as objects, 
 and even invent new languages and artificial syntaxes, 
 are a common source 
of such occurrences both in dreams and in the psychoneuroses.
 

The analysis of nonsensical word-formations in dreams is particularly well suited to demonstrate the degree of condensation 
effected in the dream-work.
 From the small number of the 
selected examples here considered it must not be concluded that 
such material is seldom observed or is at all exceptional.
 It is, 
 
on the contrary, 
 very frequent, 
 but owing to the dependence of 
dream-interpretation on psychoanalytic treatment very few examples are noted down and reported, 
 and most of the analyses 
which are reported are comprehensible only to the specialist in 
neuropathology.
 

When a spoken utterance, 
 expressly distinguished as such 
from a thought, 
 occurs in a dream, 
 it is an invariable rule that 
the dream-speech has originated from a remembered speech in 
the dream-material.
 The wording of the speech has either been 
preserved in its entirety or has been slightly altered in expression;
 frequently the dream-speech is pieced together from different recollections of spoken remarks;
 the wording has remained the same, 
 but the sense has perhaps become ambiguous, 
 
or differs from the wording.
 Not infrequently the dream-speech 
serves merely as an allusion to an incident in connection with 
which the remembered speech was made .

B.
 THE WORK OF DISPLACEMENT 

Another and probably no less significant relation must have 
already forced itself upon our attention while we were collecting 
examples of dream-condensation.
 We may have noticed that 
these elements which obtrude themselves in the dream-content 
as its essential components do not by any means play this same 
part in the dream-thoughts.
 As a corollary to this, 
 the converse 
of this statement is also true.
 That which is obviously the essential content of the dream-thoughts need not be represented at all 
in the dream.
 The dream is, 
 as it were, 
 centred elsewhere;
 its 
content is arranged about elements which do not constitute the 
central point of the dream-thoughts.
 Thus, 
 for ex ample, 
 in the 
dream of the botanical monograph the central point of the dreamcontent is evidently the element botanical;
 in the dreamthoughts we are concerned with the complications and conflicts 
resulting from services rendered between colleagues which place 
them under mutual obligations ;
 later on with the reproach t hat 
I am in the habit of sacrificing too much time to my hobbies;
 and 
the element botanical 55 finds no place in this nucleus of the 
dream-thoughts, 
 unless it is loosely connected with it by antithesis, 
 for botany was never among my favourite subjects.
 In the 
Sappho-dream of my patient, 
 ascending and descending, 
 being 
upstairs and down, 
 is made the central point;
 the dream, 
 however, 
 is concerned with the danger of sexual relations with persons of low degree;
 so that only one of the elements of the 
dream-thoughts seems to have found its way into the dreamcontent, 
 and this is unduly expanded.
 Again, 
 in the dream of my 
uncle, 
 the fair beard, 
 which seems to be its central point, 
 appears 
to have no rational connection with the desire for greatness which 
we have recognized as the nucleus of the dream-thoughts.
 Such 
dreams very naturally give us an impression of a displacement .
 5 5 
In complete contrast to these examples, 
 the dream of Irma 5 s 
injection shows that individual elements may claim the same 
place in dream-formation as that which they occupy in the 
dream-thoughts.
 The recognition of this new and utterly inconstant relation between the dream-thoughts and the dreamcontent will probably astonish us at first.
 If we find in a psychic 
process of normal life that one idea has been selected from 
among a number of others, 
 and has acquired a particular emphasis in our consciousness, 
 we are wont to regard this as proof that 
a peculiar psychic value (a certain degree of interest) attaches 
to the victorious idea.
 We now discover that this value of the 
individual element in the dream-thoughts is not retained in 
dream-formation, 
 or is not taken into account.
 For there is no 
doubt which of the elements of the dream-thoughts are of the 
highest value;
 our judgment informs us immediately.
 In dreamformation the essential elements, 
 those that are emphasized by 
intensive interest, 
 may be treated as though they were subordinate, 
 while they are replaced in the dream by other elements, 
 
which were certainly subordinate in the dream- thoughts.
 It seems 
at first as though the psychic intensity 9 of individual ideas were 
of no account in their selection for dream-formation, 
 but only 
their greater or lesser multiplicity of determination.
 One might 
be inclined to think that what gets into the dream is not what is 
important in the dream-thoughts, 
 but what is contained in them 
several times over;
 but our understanding of dream- formation 
is not much advanced by this assumption;
 to begin with, 
 we 
cannot believe that the two motives of multiple determination 
and intrinsic value can influence the selection of the dream otherwise than in the same direction.
 Those ideas in the dreamthoughts which are most important are probably also those which 
recur most frequently, 
 since the individual dream-thoughts radiate from them as centres.
 And yet the dream may reject these 
intensively emphasized and extensively reinforced elements, 
 and 
may take up into its content other elements which are only 
extensively reinforced.
 

This difficulty may be solved if we follow up yet another impression received during the investigation of the over-determination of the dream-content.
 Many readers of this investigation 
may already have decided, 
 in their own minds, 
 that the discovery 
of the multiple determination of the dream-elements is of no 
great importance, 
 because it is inevitable.
 Since in analysis we 
proceed from the dream-elements, 
 and register all the ideas which 
associate themselves with these elements, 
 is it any wonder that 
these elements should recur with peculiar frequency in the 
thought-material obtained in this manner? While I cannot admit 
the validity of this objection, 
 I am now going to say something 
that sounds rather like it: Among the thoughts which analysis 
brings to light are many which are far removed from the nucleus 
of the dream, 
 and which stand out like artificial interpolations 
made for a definite purpose.
 Their purpose may readily be detected;
 they establish a connection, 
 often a forced and farfetched connection, 
 between the dream-content and the dreamthoughts, 
 and in many cases, 
 if these elements were weeded out 
of the analysis, 
 the components of the dream-content would not 
only not be over-determined, 
 but they would not be sufficiently 
determined.
 We are thus led to the conclusion that multiple determination, 
 decisive as regards the selection made by the dream, 
 
is perhaps not always a primary factor in dream-formation, 
 but 
is often a secondary product of a psychic force which is as yet 
unknown to us.
 Nevertheless, 
 it must be of importance for the 
entrance of the individual elements into the dream, 
 for we may 
observe that in cases where multiple determination does not 
proceed easily from the dream-material it is brought about with 
a certain effort.
 

It now becomes very probable that a psychic force expresses 
itself in the dream-work which, 
 on the one hand, 
 strips the elements of the high psychic value of their intensity and, 
 on the 
other hand, 
 by means of over-determination , 
 creates new significant values from elements of slight value, 
 which new values then 
make their way into the dream-content.
 Now if this is the 
method of procedure, 
 there has occurred in the process of dreamformation a transference and displacement of the psychic intensities of the individual elements, 
 from which results the textual 
difference between the dream-content and the thought-content.
 
The process which we here assume to be operative is actually the 
most essential part of the dream-work;
 it may fitly be called 
dream-displacement .
 Dream-displacement and dream-condensation are the two craftsmen to whom we may chiefly ascribe the 
structure of the dream.
 

I think it will be easy to recognize the psychic force which 
expresses itself in dream-displacement.
 The result of this displacement is that the dream-content no longer has any likeness 
to the nucleus of the dream-thoughts, 
 and the dream reproduces 
only a distorted form of the dream-wish in the unconscious.
 But 
we are already acquainted with dream-distortion;
 we have traced 
it back to the censorship which one psychic instance in the psychic life exercises over another.
 Dream-displacement is one of 
the chief means of achieving this distortion.
 Is fecit , 
 cut profuit.
 
We must assume that dream-displacement is brought about by 
the influence of this censorship, 
 the endopsychic defence .
 10 

10 Since I regard the attribution of dream-distortion to the censorship as 
the central point of my conception of the dream, 
 I will here quote the dosing passage of a story, 
 Trdumen wie Wachen, 
 from Phantaszen eines Realisten , 
 by Lynkeus (Vienna, 
 second edition, 
 1900) , 
 in which I find this chief 
feature of my doctrine reproduced: 

Concerning a man who possesses the remarkable faculty of never dreams 
ing nonsense.
 .
 .
 

The manner in which the factors of displacement, 
 condensation and over-determination interact with one another in dreamformation — which is the ruling factor and which the subordinate 
one — all this will be reserved as a subject for later investigation.
 
In the meantime, 
 we may state, 
 as a second condition which the 
elements that find their way into the dream must satisfy, 
 that 
they must be withdrawn from the resistance of the censorship .
 
But henceforth, 
 in the interpretation of dreams, 
 we shall reckon 
with dream-displacement as an unquestionable fact.
 

C.
 THE MEANS OF REPRESENTATION IN DREAMS 

Besides the two factors of condensation and displacement in 
dreams, 
 which we have found to be at work in the transformation of the latent dream-material into the manifest dream-content, 
 we shall, 
 in the course of this investigation, 
 come upon two 
further conditions which exercise an unquestionable influence 

Your marvellous faculty of dreaming as if you were awake is based 
upon your virtues, 
 upon your goodness, 
 your justice, 
 and your love of 
truth;
 it is the moral clarity of your nature which makes everything about 
you intelligible to me.
 

But if I really give thought to the matter, 
 was the reply, 
 I almost 
believe that all men are made as I am, 
 and that no one ever dreams nonsense ! A dream which one remembers so distinctly that one can relate it 
afterwards, 
 and which, 
 therefore, 
 is no dream of delirium, 
 always has a 
meaning;
 why, 
 it cannot be otherwise! For that which is in contradiction 
to itself can never be combined into a whole.
 The fact that time and space 
are often thoroughly shaken up, 
 detracts not at all from the real content 
of the dream, 
 because both are without any significance whatever for its 
essential content.
 We often do the same thing in waking life;
 think of fairytales, 
 of so many bold and pregnant creations of fantasy, 
 of which only a 
foolish person would say: ‘That is nonsense 1 For it isn’t possible.
’  

If only it were always possible to interpret dreams correctly, 
 as you have 
just done with mine I said the friend.
 

That is certainly not an easy task, 
 but with a little attention it must 
always be possible to the dreamer.
 — You ask why it is generally impossible ? 
In your case there seems to be something veiled in your dreams, 
 something 
unchaste in a special and exalted fashion, 
 a certain secrecy in your nature, 
 
which it is difficult to fathom;
 and that is why your dreams so often seem 
to be without meaning, 
 or even nonsensical.
 But in the profoundest sense, 
 
this is by no means the case ;
 indeed it cannot be, 
 for a man is always the 
same person, 
 whether he wakes or dreams.
 

over the selection of the material that eventually appears in 
the dream.
 But first, 
 even at the risk of seeming to interrupt our 
progress, 
 I shall take a preliminary glance at the processes by 
which the interpretation of dreams is accomplished.
 I do not 
deny that the best way of explaining them, 
 and of convincing 
the critic of their reliability, 
 would be to take a single dream as 
an example, 
 to detail its interpretation, 
 as I did (in Chapter II) 
in the case of the dream of Irma’s injection, 
 but then to assemble the dream-thoughts which I had discovered, 
 and from 
them to reconstruct the formation of the dream — that is to say, 
 
to supplement dream-analysis by dream-synthesis.
 I have done 
this with several specimens for my own instruction;
 but I cannot undertake to do it here, 
 as I am prevented by a number of 
considerations (relating to the psychic material necessary for 
such a demonstration) such as any right-thinking person would 
approve.
 In the analysis of dreams these considerations present 
less difficulty, 
 for an analysis may be incomplete and still retain 
its value, 
 even if it leads only a little way into the structure of 
the dream.
 I do not see how a synthesis, 
 to be convincing, 
 could 
be anything short of complete.
 I could give a complete synthesis 
only of the dreams of such persons as are unknown to the reading public.
 Since, 
 however, 
 neurotic patients are the only persons who furnish me with the means of making such a synthesis, 
 
this part of the description of dreams must be postponed until I 
can carry the psychological explanation of the neuroses far 
enough to demonstrate their relation to our subject .
 11 This will 
be done elsewhere.
 

From my attempts to construct dreams synthetically from 
their dream-thoughts, 
 I know that the material which is yielded 
by interpretation varies in value.
 Part of it consists of the essential dream-thoughts, 
 which would completely replace the 
dream and would in themselves be a sufficient substitute for it, 
 
were there no dream-censorship.
 To the other part one is wont 
to ascribe slight importance, 
 nor does one set any value on the 
assertion that all these thoughts have participated in the formation of the dream;
 on the contrary, 
 they may include notions 
which are associated with experiences that have occurred subsequently to the dream, 
 between the dream and the interpretation.
 This part comprises not only all the connecting-paths 
which have led from the manifest to the latent dream-content, 
 
but also the intermediate and approximating associations by 
means of which one has arrived at a knowledge of these connecting-paths during the work of interpretation.
 

At this point we are interested exclusively in the essential 
dream-thoughts.
 These commonly reveal themselves as a complex of thoughts and memories of the most intricate possible 
construction, 
 with all the characteristics of the thought-processes 
known to us in waking life.
 Not infrequently they are trains of 
thought which proceed from more than one centre, 
 but which 
are not without points of contact;
 and almost invariably we 
find, 
 along with a train of thought, 
 its contradictory counterpart, 
 connected with it by the association of contrast.
 

The individual parts of this complicated structure naturally 
stand in the most manifold logical relations to one another.
 They 
constitute foreground and background, 
 digressions, 
 illustrations, 
 conditions, 
 lines of argument and objections.
 When the 
whole mass of these dream-thoughts is subjected to the pressure 
of the dream-work, 
 during which the fragments are turned 
about, 
 broken up and compacted, 
 somewhat like drifting ice, 
 
the question arises, 
 what becomes of the logical ties which had 
hitherto provided the framework of the structure? What representation do if, 
 because, 
 as though, 
 although, 
 either 
—or and all the other conjunctions, 
 without which we cannot 
understand a phrase or a sentence, 
 receive in our dreams? 

To begin with, 
 we must answer that the dream has at its disposal no means of representing these logical relations between 
the dream-thoughts.
 In most cases it disregards all these conjunctions, 
 and undertakes the elaboration only of the material 
content of the dream-thoughts.
 It is left to the interpretation 
of the dream to restore the coherence which the dream-work 
has destroyed.
 

If dreams lack the ability to express these relations, 
 the 
psychic material of which they are wrought must be responsible 
for this defect.
 As a matter of fact, 
 the representative arts — 
painting and sculpture — are similarly restricted, 
 as compared 
with poetry, 
 which is able to employ speech;
 and here again 
the reason for this limitation lies in the material by the elaboration of which the two plastic arts endeavour to express something.
 Before the art of painting arrived at an understanding of 
the laws of expression by which it is bound, 
 it attempted to 
make up for this deficiency.
 In old paintings little labels hung 
out of the mouths of the persons represented, 
 giving in writing 
the speech which the artist despaired of expressing in the picture.
 

Here, 
 perhaps an objection will be raised, 
 challenging the 
' assertion that our dreams dispense with the representation of 
logical relations.
 There are dreams in which the most complicated intellectual operations take place;
 arguments for and 
against are adduced, 
 jokes and comparisons are made, 
 just as 
in our waking thoughts.
 But here again appearances are deceptive;
 if the interpretation of such dreams is continued it will 
be found that all these things are dream-material , 
 not the representation of intellectual activity in the dream .
 The content of 
the dream-thoughts is reproduced by the apparent thinking in 
our dreams, 
 but not the relations of the dream-thoughts to one 
another, 
 in the determination of which relations thinking consists.
 I shall give some examples of this.
 But the fact which is 
most easily established is that all speeches which occur in dreams, 
 
and which are expressly designated as such, 
 are unchanged or 
only slightly modified replicas of speeches which occur likewise 
among the memories in the dream-material.
 Often the speech is 
only an allusion to an event contained in the dream-thoughts;
 
the meaning of the dream is quite different.
 

However, 
 I shall not dispute the fact that even critical thoughtactivity, 
 which does not simply repeat material from the dreamthoughts, 
 plays a part in dream-formation.
 I shall have to explain the influence of this factor at the close of this discussion.
 
It will then become clear that this thought activity is evoked not 
by the dream-thoughts, 
 but by the dream itself, 
 after it is, 
 in a 
certain sense, 
 already completed.
 

Provisionally, 
 then, 
 it is agreed that the logical relations between the dream-thoughts do not obtain any particular representation in the dream.
 For instance, 
 where there is a contradiction in the dream, 
 this is either a contradiction directed 
against the dream itself or a contradiction contained in one of 
the dream- thoughts;
 a contradiction in the dream corresponds 
with a contradiction between the dream-thoughts only in the 
most indirect and intermediate fashion.
 

But just as the art of painting finally succeeded in depicting, 
 
in the persons represented, 
 at least the intentions behind their 
words — tenderness, 
 menace, 
 admonition, 
 and the like — by other 
means than by floating labels, 
 so also the dream has found it 
possible to render an account of certain of the logical relations 
between its dream-thoughts by an appropriate modification of 
the peculiar method of dream-representation.
 It will be found 
by experience that different dreams go to different lengths in 
this respect;
 while one dream will entirely disregard the logical 
structure of its material, 
 another attempts to indicate it as completely as possible.
 In so doing the dream departs more or less 
widely from the text which it has to elaborate;
 and its attitude 
is equally variable in respect to the temporal articulation of 
the dream-thoughts, 
 if such has been established in the unconscious (as, 
 for example, 
 in the dream of Irma’s injection) .
 

But what are the means by which the dream-work is enabled 
to indicate those relations in the dream-material which are difficult to represent? I shall attempt to enumerate these, 
 one by 
one.
 

In the first place, 
 the dream renders an account of the connection which is undeniably present between all the.
 portions of 
the dream-thoughts by combining this material into a unity as 
a situation or a proceeding.
 It reproduces logical connection in 
the form of simultaneity;
 in this case it behaves rather like the 
painter who groups together all the philosophers or poets in a 
picture of the School of Athens, 
 or Parnassus.
 They never were 
assembled in any hall or on any mountain-top, 
 although to the 
reflective mind they do constitute a community.
 

The dream carries out in detail this mode of representation.
 
Whenever it shows two elements close together, 
 it vouches for 
a particularly intimate connection between their corresponding 
representatives in the dream-thoughts.
 It is as in our method 
of writing: to signifies that the two letters are to be pronounced 
as one syllable;
 while t with o following a blank space indicates 
that t is the last letter of one word and o the first letter of another.
 Consequently, 
 dream-combinations are not made up of 
arbitrary, 
 completely incongruous elements of the dream-mate* 
rial, 
 but of elements that are pretty intimately related in the 
dream-thoughts also.
 

For representing causal relations our dreams employ two 
methods, 
 which are essentially reducible to one.
 The method of 
representation more frequently employed — in cases, 
 for example, 
 where the dream-thoughts are to the effect: Because 
this was thus and thus, 
 this and that must happen — consists 
in making the subordinate clause a prefatory dream and joining 
the principal clause on to it in the form of the main dream.
 If my 
interpretation is correct, 
 the sequence may likewise be reversed.
 
The principal clause always corresponds to that part of the 
dream which is elaborated in the greatest detail.
 

An excellent example of such a representation of causality 
was once provided by a female patient, 
 whose dream I shall subsequently give in full.
 The dream consisted of a short prologue, 
 
and of a very circumstantial and very definitely centred dreamcomposition.
 I might entitle it Flowery language.
 The preliminary dream is as follows: She goes to the two maids in the 
kitchen and scolds them for taking so long to prepare  a little 
bite of food She also sees a very large number of heavy kitchen 
utensils in the kitchen turned upside down in order to drain , 
 
even heaped up in stacks .
 The two maids go to fetch water , 
 and 
have , 
 as it were , 
 to climb into a river, 
 which reaches up to the 
house or into the courtyard .
 

Then follows the main dream, 
 which begins as follows: She is 
climbing down from a height over a curiously shaped trellis, 
 and 
she is glad that her dress doesn’t get caught anywhere, 
 etc .
 Now 
the preliminary dream refers to the house of the lady’s parents.
 
The words which are spoken in the kitchen are words which she 
has probably often heard spoken by her mother.
 The piles of 
clumsy pots and pans are taken from an unpretentious hardware 
shop located in the same house.
 The second part of this 
dream contains an allusion to the dreamer’s father, 
 who was 
always pestering the maids, 
 and who during a flood — for the 
house stood dose to the bank of the river — contracted a fatal 
illness.
 The thought which is concealed behind the preliminary 
dream is something like this: Because I was born in this house, 
 
in such sordid and unpleasant surroundings .
 .
 The main 
dream takes up the same thought, 
 and presents it in a form that 
has been altered by a wish-fulfilment: I am of exalted origin.
 
Properly then: Because I am of such humble origin, 
 the course 
of my life has been so and so.
 

As far as I can see, 
 the division of a dream into two unequal 
portions does not always signify a causal relation between the 
thoughts of the two portions.
 It often seems as though in the 
two dreams the same material were presented from different 
points of view;
 this is certainly the case when a series of dreams, 
 
dreamed the same night, 
 end in a seminal emission, 
 the so matic 
need enforcing a more and more definite expression.
 Or the two 
dreams have proceeded from two separate centres in the dreammaterial, 
 and they overlap one another in the content, 
 so that 
the subject which in one dream constitutes the centre co-operates 
in the other as an allusion, 
 and vice versa.
 But in a certain number of dreams the division into short preliminary dreams and 
long subsequent dreams actually signifies a causal relation between the two portions.
 The other method of representing the 
causal relation is employed with less comprehensive material, 
 
and consists in the transformation of an image in the dream into 
another image, 
 whether it be of a person or a thing.
 Only where 
this transformation is actually seen occurring in the dream shall 
we seriously insist on the causal relation ;
 not where we simply note 
that one thing has taken the place of another.
 I said that both 
methods of representing the causal relation are really reducible 
to the same method;
 in both cases causation is represented by 
succession, 
 sometimes by the succession of dreams, 
 sometimes 
by the immediate transformation of one image into another.
 In 
the great majority of cases, 
 of course, 
 the causal relation is not 
represented at all, 
 but is effaced amidst the succession of elements that is unavoidable even in the dream-process.
 

Dreams are quite incapable of expressing the alternative 
"either — or;
 it is their custom to take both members of this 
alternative into the same context, 
 as though they had an equal 
right to be there.
 A classic example of this is contained in the 
dream of Irma’s injection.
 Its latent thoughts obviously mean: 
I am not responsible for the persistence of Irma’s pains;
 the responsibility rests either with her resistance to accepting the 
solution or with the fact that she is living under unfavourable 
sexual conditions, 
 which I am unable to change, 
 or her pains 
are not hysterical at all, 
 but organic.
 The dream, 
 however, 
 carries out all these possibilities, 
 which are almost mutually exclusive, 
 and is quite ready to add a fourth solution derived from 
the dream-wish.
 After interpreting the dream, 
 I then inserted 
the either — or in its context in the dream-thoughts.
 

But when in narrating a dream the narrator is inclined to employ the alternative either — or: It was either a garden or a 
living-room, 
 etc.
, 
 there is not really an alternative in the dreamthoughts, 
 but an and — a simple addition.
 When we use either 
— or we are as a rule describing a quality of vagueness in some 
element of the dream, 
 but a vagueness which may still be cleared 
up.
 The rule to be applied in this case is as follows: The individual members of the alternative are to be treated as equal and 
connected by an and.
 For instance, 
 after waiting long and 
vainly for the address of a friend who is travelling in Italy, 
 I 
dream that I receive a telegram which gives me the address.
 On 
the telegraph form I see printed in blue letters: the first word is 
blurred — perhaps via 

or villa;
 the second is distinctly Sezemo , 
 
or even ( Casa ).
 

The second word, 
 which reminds me of Italian names, 
 and of 
our discussions on etymology, 
 also expresses my annoyance in 
respect of the fact that my friend has kept his address a secret 
from me;
 but each of the possible first three words may be recognized on analysis as an independent and equally justifiable 
starting-point in the concatenation of ideas.
 

During the night before the funeral of my father I dreamed 0/.
 
a printed placard, 
 a card or poster rather like the notices in the 
waiting-rooms of railway stations which announce that smoking 
is prohibited.
 The sign reads either: — 

You are requested to shut the eyes 
or 

You are requested to shut one eye 

an alternative which I am in the habit of representing in the 
following form: 


the 

You are requested to shut eye(s) .
 

one 

Each of the two versions has its special meaning, 
 and leads 
along particular paths in the dream-interpretation.
 I had made 
the simplest possible funeral arrangements, 
 for I knew what the 
deceased thought about such matters.
 Other members of the 
family, 
 however, 
 did not approve of such puritanical simplicity;
 
they thought we should feel ashamed in the presence of the other 
mourners.
 Hence one of the wordings of the dream asks for the 
shutting of one eye, 
 that is to say, 
 it asks that people should 
show consideration.
 The significance of the vagueness, 
 which 
is here represented by an either — or, 
 is plainly to be seen.
 The 
dream-work has not succeeded in concocting a coherent and yet 
ambiguous wording for the dream-thoughts.
 Thus the two principal trains of thought are separated from each other, 
 even in 
the dream-content.
 

In some few cases the division of a dream into two equal parts 
expresses the alternative which the dream finds it so difficult to 
present.
 

The attitude of dreams to the category of antithesis and contradiction is very striking.
 This category is simply ignored;
 the 
word No does not seem to exist for a dream.
 Dreams are particularly fond of reducing antitheses to uniformity, 
 or representing them as one and the same thing.
 Dreams likewise take 
the liberty of representing any element whatever by its desired 
opposite, 
 so that it is at first impossible to tell, 
 in respect of any 
element which is capable of having an opposite, 
 whether it is 
contained in the dream-thoughts in the negative or the positive 
sense .
 12 In one of the recently cited dreams, 
 whose introductory 
portion we have already interpreted (because my origin is so 
and so), 
 the dreamer climbs down over a trellis, 
 and holds a 
blossoming bough in her hands.
 Since this picture suggests to 
her the angel in paintings of the Annunciation (her own name is 
Mary) bearing a lily-stem in his hand, 
 and the white-robed girls 
walking in procession on Corpus Christ! Day, 
 when the streets 
are decorated with green boughs, 
 the blossoming bough in the 
dream is quite clearly an allusion to sexual innocence.
 But the 
bough is thickly studded with red blossoms, 
 each of which resembles a camellia.
 At the end of her walk (so the dream continues) the blossoms are already beginning to fall;
 then follow 
unmistakable allusions to menstruation.
 But this very bough, 
 
which is carried like a lily-stem and as though by an innocent 
girl, 
 is also an allusion to Camille, 
 who, 
 as we know, 
 usually wore 
a white camellia, 
 but a red one during menstruation.
 The same 
blossoming bough (the flower of maidenhood in Goethe's 
songs of the miller's daughter) represents at once sexual innocence and its opposite.
 Moreover, 
 the same dream, 
 which expresses the dreamer’s joy at having succeeded in passing through 
life unsullied, 
 hints in several places (as in the falling of the 
blossom) at the opposite train of thought, 
 namely, 
 that she had 
been guilty of various sins against sexual purity (that is, 
 in her 
childhood).
 In the analysis of the dream we may clearly distinguish the two trains of thought, 
 of which the comforting one 
seems to be superficial, 
 and the reproachful one more profound.
 
The two are diametrically opposed to each other, 
 and their 
similar yet contrasting elements have been represented by identical dream-elements.
 

The mechanism of dream-formation is favourable in the highest degree to only one of the logical relations.
 This relation is 
that of similarity, 
 agreement, 
 contiguity, 
 just as;
 a relation 
which may be represented in our dreams, 
 as no other can be, 
 by 
the most varied expedients.
 The screening which occurs in 
the dream-material, 
 or the cases of just as, 
 are the chief points 
of support for dream-formation, 
 and a not inconsiderable part 
of the dream-work consists in creating new screenings of this 
kind in cases where those that already exist are prevented by 
the resistance of the censorship from making their way into the 
dream.
 The effort towards condensation evinced by the dreamw Y ork facilitates the representation of a relation of similarity.
 

Similarity, 
 agreement, 
 community, 
 are quite generally expressed in dreams by contraction into a unity, 
 which is either 
already found in the dream-material or is newly created.
 The 
first case may be referred to as identification, 
 the second as 
composition.
 Identification is used where the dream is concerned 
with persons, 
 composition where things constitute the material 
to be unified;
 but compositions are also made of persons.
 Localities are often treated as persons.
 

Identification consists in giving representation in the dreamcontent to only one of two or more persons who are related by 
some common feature, 
 while the second person or other persons 
appear to be suppressed as far as the dream is concerned.
 In 
the dream this one screening person enters into all the relations and situations which derive from the persons whom she 
screens.
 In cases of composition, 
 however, 
 when persons are 
combined, 
 there are already present in the dream-image features which are characteristic of, 
 but not common to, 
 the persons in question, 
 so that a new unity, 
 a composite person, 
 appears as the result of the union of these features.
 The combination itself may be effected in various ways.
 Either the dreamperson bears the name of one of the persons to whom he refers 
— and in this case we simply know, 
 in a manner that is quite 
analogous to knowledge in waking life, 
 that this or that person 
is intended — while the visual features belong to another person;
 
or the dream-image itself is compounded of visual ieatures 
which in reality are derived from the two.
 Also, 
 in place of the 
visual features, 
 the part played by the second person may be 
represented by the attitudes and gestures which are usually 
ascribed to him by the words he speaks, 
 or by the situations in 
which he is placed.
 In this latter method of characterization the 
sharp distinction between the identification and the combination 
of persons begins to disappear.
 But it may also happen that the 
formation of such a composite person is unsuccessful.
 The situations or actions of the dream are then attributed to one person, 
 
and the other — as a rule the more important — is introduced as 
an inactive spectator.
 Perhaps the dreamer will say : My mother 
was there too (Stekel).
 Such an element of the dream-content 
is then comparable to a determinative in hieroglyphic script 
which is not meant to be expressed, 
 but is intended only to explain another sign.
 

The common feature which justifies the union of two persons 
— that is to say, 
 which enables it to be made — may either be 
represented in the dream or it may be absent.
 As a rule identification or composition of persons actually serves to avoid the 
necessity of representing this common feature.
 Instead of repeating: A is ill-disposed towards me, 
 and so is B, 
 I make, 
 in 
my dream, 
 a composite person of A and B;
 or I conceive A as 
doing something which is alien to his character, 
 but which is 
characteristic of B.
 The dream-person obtained in this way appears in the dream in some new connection, 
 and the fact that 
he signifies both A and B justifies my inserting that which is 
common to both persons — their hostility towards me — at the 
proper place in the dream-interpretation.
 In this manner I often 
achieve a quite extraordinary degree of condensation of the 
dream-content;
 I am able to dispense with the direct representation of the very complicated relations belonging to one person, 
 
if I can find a second person who has an equal claim to some of 
these relations.
 It will be readily understood how far this representation by means of identification may circumvent the censoring resistance which sets up such harsh conditions for the 
dream-work.
 The thing that offends the censorship may reside 
in those very ideas which are connected in the dream-material 
with the one person;
 I now find a second person, 
 who likewise 
stands in some relation to the objectionable material, 
 but only 
to a part of it.
 Contact at that one point which offends the censorship now justifies my formation of a composite person, 
 who 
is characterized by the indifferent features of each.
 This person, 
 
the result of combination or identification, 
 being free of the 
censorship, 
 is now suitable for incorporation in the dreamcontent.
 Thus, 
 by the application of dream-condensation, 
 I have 
satisfied the demands of the dream-censorship.
 

When a common feature of two persons is represented in a 
dream, 
 this is usually a hint to look for another concealed common feature, 
 the representation of which is made impossible by 
the censorship.
 Here a displacement of the common feature has 
occurred, 
 which in some degree facilitates representation.
 From 
the circumstance that the composite person is shown to me in 
the dream with an indifferent common feature, 
 I must infer 
that another common feature which is by no means indifferent 
exists in the dream-thoughts.
 

Accordingly, 
 the identification or combination of persons 
serves various purposes in our dreams;
 in the first place, 
 that 
of representing a feature common to two persons;
 secondly, 
 that 
of representing a displaced common feature;
 and, 
 thirdly, 
 that 
of expressing a community of features which is merely wished 
for .
 As the wish for a community of features in two persons 
often coincides with the interchanging of these persons, 
 this relation also is expressed in dreams by identification.
 In the dream 
of Irma’s injection I wish to exchange one patient for another — 
that is to say, 
 I wish this other person to be my patient, 
 as the 
former person has been;
 the dream deals with this wish by 
showing me a person who is called Irma, 
 but who is examined in 
a position such as I have had occasion to see only the other person occupy.
 In the dream about my uncle this substitution is 
made the centre of the dream ;
 I identify myself with the minister by judging and treating my colleagues as shabbily as he does.
 

It has been my experience — and to this I have found no exception— that every dream treats of oneself.
 Dreams are absolutely 
egoistic.
 13 In cases where not my ego but only a strange 
person occurs in the dream-content, 
 I may safely assume that 
by means of identification my ego is concealed behind that person.
 I am permitted to supplement my ego.
 On other occasions, 
 
when my ego appears in the dream, 
 the situation in which it is 
placed tells me that another person is concealing himself, 
 by 
means of identification, 
 behind the ego.
 In this case I must be 
prepared to find that in the interpretation I should transfer 
something which is connected with this person — the hidden 
common feature — to myself.
 There are also dreams in which my 
ego appears together with other persons who, 
 when the identification is resolved, 
 once more show themselves to be my ego.
 
Through these identifications I shall then have to connect with 
my ego certain ideas to which the censorship has objected.
 I 
may also give my ego multiple representation in my dream, 
 
either directly or by means of identification with other people.
 By means of several such identifications an extraordinary 
amount of thought material may be condensed.
 14 That one’s 
ego should appear in the same dream several times or in different 
forms is fundamentally no more surprising than that it should 
appear, 
 in conscious thinking, 
 many times and in different places 
or in different relations: as, 
 for example, 
 in the sentence: When 
I think what a healthy child I was.
 

Still easier than in the case of persons is the resolution of 
identifications in the case of localities designated by their own 
names, 
 as here the disturbing influence of the all-powerful ego 
is lacking.
 In one of my dreams of Rome (pp.
 97-8) the name of 
the place in which I find myself is Rome;
 I am surprised, 
 however, 
 by a large number of German placards at a street corner.
 
This last is a wish-fulfilment, 
 which immediately suggests 
Prague;
 the wish itself probably originated at a period of my 
youth when I was imbued with a German nationalistic spirit 
which to-day is quite subdued.
 At the time of my dream I was 
looking forward to meeting a friend in Prague;
 the identification 
of Rome with Prague is therefore explained by a desired common feature;
 I would rather meet my friend in Rome than in 
Prague;
 for the purpose of this meeting I should like to exchange 
Prague for Rome.
 

The possibility of creating composite formations is one of 
the chief causes of the fantastic character so common in dreams, 
 
in that it introduces into the dream-content elements which 
could never have been objects of perception.
 The psychic process 
which occurs in the creation of composite formations is obviously 
the same as that which we employ in conceiving or figuring a 
dragon or a centaur in our waking senses.
 The only difference 
is that in the fantastic creations of waking life the impression 
intended is itself the decisive factor, 
 while the composite formation in the dream is determined by a factor — the common feature in the dream-thoughts — which is independent of its form.
 
Composite formations in dreams may be achieved in a great 
many different ways.
 In the most artless of these methods only 
the properties of the one thing are represented, 
 and this representation is accompanied by a knowledge that they refer to another object also.
 A more careful technique combines features 
of the one object with those of the other in a new image, 
 while it 
makes skilful use of any really existing resemblances between 
the two objects.
 The new creation may prove to be wholly absurd, 
 or even successful as a fantasy, 
 according as the material 
and the wit employed in constructing it may permit.
 If the objects to be condensed into a unity are too incongruous, 
 the 
dream-work is content with creating a composite formation with 
a comparatively distinct nucleus, 
 to which are attached more 
indefinite modifications.
 The unification into one image has here 
been to some extent unsuccessful;
 the two representations overlap one another, 
 and give rise to something like a contest between the visual images.
 Similar representations might be obtained in a drawing if one were to attempt to give form to a 
unified abstraction of disparate perceptual images.
 

Dreams naturally abound in such composite formations;
 I 
have given several examples of these in the dreams already 
analysed, 
 and will now cite more such examples.
 In the dream 
on p.
 205, 
 which describes the career of my patient in flowery 
language, 
 the dream-ego carries a spray of blossom in her hand 
which, 
 as we have seen, 
 signifies at once sexual innocence and 
sexual transgression.
 Moreover, 
 from the manner in which the 
blossoms are set on, 
 they recall cherry-blossom;
 the blossoms 
themselves, 
 considered singly, 
 are camellias , 
 and finally the 
whole spray gives the dreamer the impression of an exotic plant.
 
The common feature in the elements of this composite formation is revealed by the dream-thoughts.
 The blossoming spray 
is made up of allusions to presents by which she was induced or 
was to have been induced to behave in a manner agreeable to 
the giver.
 So it was with cherries in her childhood, 
 and with a 
camellia-tree in her later years;
 the exotic character is an allusion 
to a much-travelled naturalist, 
 who sought to win her favour by 
means of a drawing of a flower.
 Another female patient contrives a composite meaning out of bathing machines at a seaside 
resort, 
 country privies , 
 and the attics of our city dwelling-houses.
 
A reference to human nakedness and exposure is common to 
the first two elements;
 and we may infer from their connection 
with the third element that (in her childhood) the garret was 
likewise the scene of bodily exposure.
 A dreamer of the male 
sex makes a composite locality out of two places in which 
treatment is given — my office and the assembly rooms in 
which he first became acquainted with his wife.
 Another, 
 a 
female patient, 
 after her elder brother has promised to regale 
her with caviare, 
 dreams that his legs are covered all over with 
black beads of caviare .
 The two elements, 
 taint in a moral 
sense and the recollection of a cutaneous eruption in childhood 
which made her legs look as though studded over with red instead of black spots, 
 have here been combined with the beads of 
caviare to form a new idea — the idea of " what she gets from her 
brother In this dream parts of the human body are treated as 
objects, 
 as is usually the case in dreams.
 In one of the dreams 
recorded by Ferenczi there occurs a composite formation made 
up of the person of a physician and a horse, 
 and this composite 
being wears a nightshirt.
 The common feature in these three 
components was revealed in the analysis, 
 after the nightshirt 
bad been recognized as an allusion to the father of the dreamer 
in a scene of childhood.
 In each of the three cases there was 
some object of her sexual curiosity.
 As a child she had often 
been taken by her nurse to the army stud, 
 where she had the 
amplest opportunity to satisfy her curiosity, 
 at that time still 
uninhibited.
 

I have already stated that the dream has no means of expressing the relation of contradiction, 
 contrast, 
 negation.
 I shall now 
contradict this assertion for the first time.
 A certain number of 
cases of what may be summed up under the word contrast 
obtain representation, 
 as we have seen, 
 simply by means of 
identification — that is, 
 when an exchange, 
 a substitution, 
 can 
be bound up with the contrast.
 Of this we have cited repeated 
examples.
 Certain other of the contrasts in the dream-thoughts, 
 
which perhaps come under the category of inverted, 
 turned into 
the opposite  are represented in dreams in the following remarkable manner, 
 which may almost be described as witty.
 The 
inversion does not itself make its way into the dream-content, 
 
but manifests its presence in the material by the fact that a part 
of the already formed dream-content which is, 
 for other reasons, 
 
closely connected in context is — as it were subsequently — inverted, 
 It is easier to illustrate this process than to describe it.
 
In the beautiful Up and Down dream (p.
 181) the dreamrepresentation of ascending is an inversion of its prototype in 
the dream- thoughts: that is, 
 of the introductory scene of Daudet’s 
Sappho ;
 in the dream climbing is difficult at first and easy later 
on, 
 whereas in the novel it is easy at first, 
 and later becomes 
more and more difficult.
 Again, 
 above and below, 
 with reference to the dreamer’s brother, 
 are reversed in the dream.
 This 
points to a relation of inversion or contrast between two parts of 
the material in the dream-thoughts, 
 which indeed we found in 
them, 
 for in the childish phantasy of the dreamer he is carried 
by his nurse, 
 while in the novel, 
 on the contrary, 
 the hero carries his beloved.
 My dream of Goethe’s attack on Herr M.
 (to 
be cited later) likewise contains an inversion of this sort, 
 which 
must be set right before the dream can be interpreted.
 In this 
dream Goethe attacks a young man, 
 Herr M.
;
 the reality, 
 as 
contained in the dream-thoughts, 
 is that an eminent man, 
 a 
friend of mine, 
 has been attacked by an unknown young author.
 

In the dream I reckon time from the date of Goethe’s death;
 in 
reality the reckoning was made from the year in which the 
paralytic was born.
 The thought which influences the dreammaterial reveals itself as my opposition to the treatment of 
Goethe as though he were a lunatic.
 It is the other way about, 
 
says the dream;
 if you don’t understand the book it is you who 
are feeble-minded, 
 not the author.
 All these dreams of inversion, 
 moreover, 
 seem to me to imply an allusion to the contemptuous phrase, 
 ‘to turn one’s back upon a person (German: 
einem die Kehrseite zeigen, 
 lit.
 to show a person one’s backside) : 
cf .
 the inversion in respect of the dreamer’s brother in the Sappho 
dream.
 It is further worth noting how frequently inversion is 
employed in precisely those dreams which are inspired by repressed homosexual impulses.
 

Moreover, 
 inversion, 
 or transformation into the opposite, 
 is 
one of the most favoured and most versatile methods of representation which the dream-work has at its disposed.
 It serves, 
 
in the first place, 
 to enable the wish-fulfilment to prevail against 
a definite element of the dream-thoughts.
 If only it were the 
other way about! is often the best expression for the reaction 
of the ego against a disagreeable recollection.
 But inversion becomes extraordinarily useful in the service of the censorship, 
 for 
it effects, 
 in the material to be represented, 
 a degree of distortion 
which at first simply paralyses our understanding of the dream.
 
It is therefore always permissible, 
 if a dream stubbornly refuses 
to surrender its meaning, 
 to venture on the experimental inversion of definite portions of its manifest content.
 Then, 
 not infrequently, 
 everything becomes clear.
 

Besides the inversion of content, 
 the temporal inversion must 
not be overlooked.
 A frequent device of dream-distortion consists in presenting the final issue of the event or the conclusion 
of the train of thought at the beginning of the dream, 
 and appending at the end of the dream the premises of the conclusion, 
 
or the causes of the event.
 Anyone who forgets this technical device of dream-distortion stands helpless before the problem of 
dream-interpretation .
 13 




2l8 the interpretation of dreams 

In many cases, 
 indeed, 
 we discover the meaning of the dream 
only when we have subjected the dream-content to a multiple inversion, 
 in accordance with the different relations.
 For example, 
 
in the dream of a young patient who is suffering from obsessional 
neurosis, 
 the memory of the childish death-wish directed against 
a dreaded father concealed itself behind the following words: 
His father scolds him because he comes home so late , 
 but the 
context of the psychoanalytic treatment and the impressions of 
the dreamer show that the sentence must be read as follows: He 
is angry with his father , 
 and further, 
 that his father always 
came home too early (i.
e.
 too soon).
 He would have preferred 
that his father should not come home at all, 
 which is identical 
with the wish (see p.
 152 ff.
) that his father would die.
 As a little 
boy, 
 during the prolonged absence of his father, 
 the dreamer 
was guilty of a sexual aggression against another child, 
 and was 
punished by the threat: Just you wait until your father comes 
home! 

If we should seek to trace the relations between the dreamcontent and the dream-thoughts a little farther, 
 we shall do this 
best by making the dream itself our point of departure, 
 and 
asking ourselves: What do certain formal characteristics of the 
dream-presentation signify in relation to the dream-thoughts? 
First and foremost among the formal characteristics which are 
bound to impress us in dreams are the differences in the sensory 
intensity of the single dream-images, 
 and in the distinctness of 
various parts of the dream, 
 or of whole dreams as compared with 
one another.
 The differences in the intensity of individual dreamimages cover the whole gamut, 
 from a sharpness of definition 
which one is inclined — although without warrant — to rate more 
highly than that of reality, 
 to a provoking indistinctness which 
we declare to be characteristic of dreams, 
 because it really is 
not wholly comparable to any of the degrees of indistinctness 
which we occasionally perceive in real objects.
 Moreover, 
 we 
usually describe the impression which we receive of an indistinct 
object in a dream as fleeting, 
 1  while we think of the more distinct dream-images as having been perceptible also for a longer 
period of time.
 We must now ask ourselves by what conditions 
in the dream-material these differences in the distinctness of 
the individual portions of the dream-content are brought about.
 

Before proceeding farther, 
 it is necessary to deal with certain 
expectations which seem to be almost inevitable.
 Since actual 
sensations experienced during sleep may constitute part of the 
dream-material, 
 it will probably be assumed that these sensations, 
 or the dream-elements resulting from them, 
 are emphasized 
by a special intensity, 
 or conversely, 
 that anything which is 
particularly vivid in the dream can probably be traced to such 
real sensations during sleep.
 My experience, 
 however, 
 has never 
confirmed this.
 It is not true that those elements of a dream 
which are derivatives of real impressions perceived in sleep 
(nerve stimuli) are distinguished by their special vividness from 
others which are based on memories.
 The factor of reality is inoperative in determining the intensity of dream-images.
 

Further, 
 it might be expected that the sensory intensity 
(vividness) of single dream-images is in proportion to the 
psychic intensity of the elements corresponding to them in the 
dream-thoughts.
 In the latter, 
 intensity is identical with psychic 
value;
 the most intense elements are in fact the most significant, 
 
and these constitute the central point of the dream-thoughts.
 
We know, 
 however, 
 that it is precisely these elements which are 
usually not admitted to the dream-content, 
 owing to the vigilance of the censorship.
 Still, 
 it might be possible for their most 
immediate derivatives, 
 which represent them in the dream, 
 to 
reach a higher degree of intensity without, 
 however, 
 for that 
reason constituting the central point of the dream-representation.
 This assumption also vanishes as soon as we compare the 
dream and the dream-material.
 The intensity of the elements 
in the one has nothing to do with the intensity of the elements 
in the other;
 as a matter of fact, 
 a complete  transvaluation of 
all psychic values  takes place between the dream-material and 
the dream.
 The very element of the dream which is transient 
and hazy, 
 and screened by more vigorous images, 
 is often discovered to be the one and only direct derivative of the topic 
that completely dominates the dream-thoughts.
 

The intensity of the dream-elements proves to be determined 
in a different manner: that is, 
 by two factors which are mutually 
independent.
 It will readily be understood that those elements 
by means of which the wish-fulfilment expresses itself are those 
which are intensely represented.
 But analysis tells us that from 
the most vivid elements of the dream the greatest number of 
trains of thought proceed, 
 and that those which are most vivid 
are at the same time those which are best determined.
 No change 
of meaning is involved if we express this latter empirical proposition in the following formula: The greatest intensity is shown 
by those elements of the dream for whose formation the most 
extensive condensation-work was required.
 We may, 
 therefore, 
 
^expect that it will be possible to express this condition, 
 as well 
as the other condition of the wish-fulfilment in a single formula.
 

I must utter a warning that the problem which I have just been 
considering — the causes of the greater or lesser intensity or 
distinctness of single elements in dreams — is not to be confounded with the other problem — that of variations in the distinctness of whole dreams or sections of dreams.
 In the former 
case the opposite of distinctness is haziness;
 in the latter, 
 confusion.
 It is, 
 of course, 
 undeniable that in both scales the two 
kinds of intensities rise and fall in unison.
 A portion of the 
dream which seems clear to us usually contains vivid elements;
 
an obscure dream, 
 on the contrary, 
 is composed of less vivid elements.
 But the problem offered by the scale of definition, 
 which 
ranges from the apparently clear to the indistinct or confused, 
 is 
far more complicated than the problem of the fluctuations in 
vividness of the dream-elements.
 For reasons which will be given 
later, 
 the former cannot at this stage be further discussed* In 
isolated cases one observes, 
 not without surprise, 
 that the impression of distinctness or indistinctness produced by a dream 
has nothing to do with the dream-structure, 
 but proceeds from 
the dream-material, 
 as one of its ingredients* Thus, 
 for example, 
 
I remember a dream which on waking seemed so particularly 
well-constructed, 
 flawless and clear that I made up my mind, 
 
while I was still in a somnolent state, 
 to admit a new category 
of dreams — those which had not been subject to the mechanism 
of condensation and distortion, 
 and which might thus be described as phantasies during sleep.
 A closer examination, 
 
however, 
 proved that this unusual dream suffered from the same 
structural flaws and breaches as exist in all other dreams;
 so I 
abandoned the idea of a category of dream-phantasies .
 16 The 
content of the dream, 
 reduced to its lowest terms, 
 was that I 
was expounding to a friend a difficult and long-sought theory of 
bisexuality, 
 and the wish-fulfilling power of the dream was responsible for the fact that this theory (which, 
 by the way, 
 was 
not communicated in the dream) appeared to be so lucid and 
flawless.
 Thus, 
 what I believed to be a judgment as regards the 
finished dream was a part, 
 and indeed the most essential part, 
 
of the dream-content.
 Here the dream-work reached out, 
 as it 
were, 
 into my first waking thoughts, 
 and presented to me, 
 in the 
form of a judgment of the dream, 
 that part of the dream-material which it had failed to represent with precision in the dream.
 
I was once confronted with die exact counterpart of this case by 
a female patient who at first absolutely declined to relate a 
dream which was necessary for the analysis because it was so 
hazy and confused, 
 and who finally declared, 
 after repeatedly 
protesting the inaccuracy of her description, 
 that it seemed to 
her that several persons — herself, 
 her husband, 
 and her father 
— had occurred in the dream, 
 and that she had not known 
whether her husband was her father, 
 or who really was her 
father, 
 or something of that sort.
 Comparison of this dream with 
the ideas which occurred to the dreamer in the course of the 
sitting showed beyond a doubt that it dealt with the rather commonplace story of a maidservant who has to confess that she is 
expecting a child, 
 and hears doubts expressed as to who the 
father really is.
 17 The obscurity manifested by this dream, 
 
therefore, 
 was once more a portion of the dream-exciting material.
 A fragment of this material was represented in the form of 
the dream.
 The form of the dream or of dreaming is employed 
with astonishing frequency to represent the concealed content .
 

Glosses on the dream, 
 and seemingly harmless comments on 
it, 
 often serve in the most subtle manner to conceal — although, 
 
of course, 
 they really betray — a part of what is dreamed.
 As, 
 for 
example, 
 when the dreamer says: Here the dream was wiped out, 
 
and the analysis gives an infantile reminiscence of listening to 
someone cleaning himself after defecation.
 Or another example, 
 
which deserves to be recorded in detail: A'young man has a very 
distinct dream, 
 reminding him of phantasies of his boyhood 
which have remained conscious.
 He found himself in a hotel at a 
seasonal resort;
 it was night;
 he mistook the number of his room, 
 
and entered a room in which an elderly lady and her two daughters were undressing to go to bed.
 He continues: u Then there 
are some gaps in the dream;
 something is missing;
 and at the 
end there was a man in the room, 
 who wanted to throw me out, 
 
and with whom I had to struggle.
 He tries in vain to recall the 
content and intention of the boyish phantasy to which the dream 
obviously alluded.
 But we finally become aware that the required content had already been given in his remarks concerning 
the indistinct part of the dream.
 The  c gaps are the genital 
apertures of the women who are going to bed: Here something 
is missing describes the principal characteristic of the female 
genitals.
 In his young days he burned with curiosity to see the 
female genitals, 
 and was still inclined to adhere to the infantile 
sexual theory which attributes a male organ to women.
 

A very similar form was assumed in an analogous reminiscence 
of another dreamer.
 He dreamed: I go with Frdulein K.
 into the 
restaurant of the Volksgarten .
 .
 .
 then comes a dark place, 
 an interruption .
 .
 .
 then I find myself in the salon of a brothel, 
 where 
1 see two or three women, 
 one in a chemise and drawers .
 

17 Accompanying hysterical symptoms;
 amenorrhoea and profound depression were the chief troubles of this patient.
 

Analysis .
 — Fraulein K.
 is the daughter of his former employer;
 as he himself admits, 
 she was a sister-substitute.
 He 
rarely had the opportunity of talking to her, 
 but they once had 
a conversation in which one recognized one’s sexuality, 
 so to 
speak, 
 as though one were to say: I am a man and you are a 
woman.
 He had been only once to the above-mentioned restaurant, 
 when he was accompanied by the sister of his brotherin-law, 
 a girl to whom he was quite indifferent.
 On another occasion he accompanied three ladies to the door of the restaurant.
 
The ladies were his sister, 
 his sister-in-law, 
 and the girl already 
mentioned.
 He was perfectly indifferent to all three of them, 
 but 
they all belonged to the sister category.
 He had visited a 
brothel but rarely, 
 perhaps two or three times in his life.
 

The interpretation is based on the dark place, 
 the interruption in the dream, 
 and informs us that on occasion, 
 but in 
fact only rarely, 
 obsessed by his boyish curiosity, 
 he had inspected the genitals of his sister, 
 a few years his junior.
 A few 
days later the misdemeanor indicated in the dream recurred to 
his conscious memory.
 

All dreams of the same night belong, 
 in respect of their content, 
 to the same whole;
 their division into several parts, 
 their 
grouping and number, 
 are all full of meaning and may be regarded as pieces of information about the latent dream-thoughts.
 
In the interpretation of dreams consisting of several main sections, 
 or of dreams belonging to the same night, 
 we must not 
overlook the possibility that these different and successive 
dreams mean the same thing, 
 expressing the same impulses in 
different material.
 That one of these homologous dreams which 
comes first in time is usually the most distorted and most bashful, 
 while the next dream is bolder and more distinct.
 

Even Pharaoh’s dream of the ears and the kine, 
 which Joseph 
interpreted, 
 was of this kind.
 It is given by Josephus in greater 
detail than in the Bible.
 After relating the first dream, 
 the King 
said: After I had seen this vision I awaked out of my sleep, 
 and, 
 
being in disorder, 
 and considering with myself what this appearance should be, 
 I fell asleep again, 
 and saw another dream 
much more wonderful than the foregoing, 
 which still did more 
affright and disturb me.
 After listening to the relation of the 
dream, 
 Joseph said: This dream, 
 0 King, 
 although seen under 
two forms, 
 signifies one and the same event of things.
 18 

Jung, 
 in his Beitrag zur Psyckologie des Geruchtes, 
 relates 
how a veiled erotic dream of a schoolgirl was understood by her 
friends without interpretation, 
 and continued by them with variations, 
 and he remarks, 
 with reference to one of these narrated 
dreams, 
 that the concluding idea of a long series of dreamimages had precisely the same content as the first image of the 
series had endeavoured to represent.
 The censorship thrust the 
complex out of the way as long as possible by a constant renewal of symbolic screenings, 
 displacements, 
 transformations 
into something harmless, 
 etc.
 Schemer was well acquainted 
with this peculiarity of dream-representation, 
 and describes it 
in his Leben des Traumes in terms of a special law in the Appendix to his doctrine of organic stimulation: But finally, 
 in 
all symbolic dream-formations emanating from definite nerve 
stimuli, 
 the phantasy observes the general law that at the beginning of the dream it depicts the stimulating object only by 
the remotest and freest allusions, 
 but towards the end, 
 when 
the graphic impulse becomes exhausted, 
 the stimulus itself is 
nakedly represented by its appropriate organ or its function;
 
whereupon the dream, 
 itself describing its organic motive, 
 
achieves its end  

A pretty confirmation of this law of Schemer’s has been furnished by Otto Rank in his essay: Ein Traum, 
 der sick selbst 
deuteL This dream, 
 related to him by a girl, 
 consisted of two 
dreams of the same night, 
 separated by an interval of time, 
 the 
second of which ended with an orgasm.
 It was possible to interpret this orgastic dream in detail in spite of the few ideas contributed by the dreamer, 
 and the wealth of relations between 
the two dream-contents made it possible to recognize that the 
first dream expressed in modest language the same thing as the 
second, 
 so that the latter — the orgastic dream — facilitated a 
full explanation of the former.
 From this example, 
 Rank very 
justifiably argues the significance of orgastic dreams for the 
theory of dreams in general.
 

But in my experience it is only in rare cases that one is in a 
position to translate the lucidity or confusion of a dream, 
 respectively, 
 into a certainty or doubt in the dream-material.
 
Later on I shall have to disclose a hitherto unmentioned factor 
in dream-formation, 
 upon whose operation this qualitative scale 
in dreams is essentially dependent.
 

In many dreams in which a certain situation and environment 
are preserved for some time, 
 there occur interruptions which 
may be described in the following words: But then it seemed 
as though it were, 
 at the same time, 
 another place, 
 and there 
such and such a thing happened.
 In these cases what interrupts 
the main action of the dream, 
 which after a while may be continued again, 
 reveals itself in the dream-material as a subordinate clause, 
 an interpolated thought.
 Conditionality in the 
dream-thoughts is represented by simultaneity in the dreamcontent ( wenn or wann = if or when, 
 while) .
 

We may now ask, 
 What is the meaning of the sensation of inhibited movement which so often occurs in dreams, 
 and is so 
closely allied to anxiety? One wants to move, 
 and is unable to 
stir from the spot;
 or wants to accomplish something, 
 and encounters obstacle after obstacle.
 The train is about to start, 
 and 
one cannot reach it;
 one’s hand is raised to avenge an insult, 
 
and its strength fails, 
 etc.
 We have already met with this sensation in exhibition-dreams, 
 but have as yet made no serious attempt to interpret it.
 It is convenient, 
 but inadequate, 
 to answer 
that there is motor paralysis in sleep, 
 which manifests itself by 
means of the sensation alluded to.
 We may ask: Why is it, 
 then, 
 
that we do not dream continually of such inhibited movements? 
And we may permissibly suspect that this sensation, 
 which may 
at any time occur during sleep, 
 serves some sort of purpose for 
representation, 
 and is evoked only when the need of this representation is present in the dream-material.
 

Inability to do a thing does not always appear in the dream 
as a sensation;
 it may appear simply as part of the dream-content.
 I think one case of this kind is especially fitted to enlighten 
us as to the meaning of this peculiarity.
 I shall give an abridged 
version of a dream in which I seem to be accused of dishonesty.
 
The scene is a mixture made up oj a private sanatorium and several other places .
 A manservant appears , 
 to summon me to an 
inquiry .
 1 know in the dream that something has been missed , 
 
and that the inquiry is taking place because I am suspected of 
having appropriated the lost article .
 Analysis shows that inquiry 
is to be taken in two senses ;
 it includes the meaning of medical 
examination .
 Being conscious of my innocence , 
 and my position 
as consultant in this sanatorium , 
 I calmly follow the manservant.
 
We are received at the door by another manservant who says, 
 
pointing at me, 
 Have you brought him? Why, 
 he is a respectable 
man  Thereupon, 
 and unattended, 
 I enter a great hall where 
there are many machines, 
 which reminds me of an inferno with 
its hellish instruments of punishment .
 I see a colleague strapped 
to an appliance;
 he has every reason to be interested in my appearance, 
 but he takes no notice of me.
 I understand that I may 
now go.
 Then I cannot find my hat, 
 and cannot go after all .
 

The wish that the dream fulfils is obviously the wish that my 
honesty shall be acknowledged, 
 and that I may be permitted to 
go;
 there must therefore be all sorts of material in the dreamthoughts which comprise a contradiction of this wish.
 The fact 
that I may go is the sign of my absolution;
 if, 
 then, 
 the dream 
provides at its close an event which prevents me from going, 
 
we may readily conclude that the suppressed material of the 
contradiction is asserting itself in this feature.
 The fact that I 
cannot find my hat therefore means: You are not after all an 
honest man.
 The inability to do something in the dream is the 
expression of a contradiction, 
 a No ;
 so that our earlier assertion, 
 to the effect that the dream is not capable of expressing a 
negation, 
 must be revised accordingly.
 19 

In other dreams in which the inability to do something occurs, 
 
not merely as a situation v but also as a sensation, 
 the same contradiction is more emphatically expressed by the sensation of 
inhibited movement, 
 or a will to which a counter-will is opposed.
 
Thus the sensation of inhibited movement represents a conflict 
of will.
 We shall see later on that this very motor paralysis during sleep is one of the fundamental conditions of the psychic 
process which functions during dreaming.
 Now an impulse which 
is conveyed to the motor system is none other than the will, 
 and 
the fact that we are certain that this impulse will be inhibited in 
sleep makes the whole process extraordinarily well-adapted to 
the representation of a will towards something and of a No 
which opposes itself thereto.
 From my explanation of anxiety, 
 
it is easy to understand why the sensation of the inhibited will 
is so closely allied to anxiety, 
 and why it is so often connected 
with it in dreams.
 Anxiety is a libidinal impulse which emanates 
from the unconscious and is inhibited by the preconscious .
 20 
Therefore, 
 when a sensation of inhibition in the dream is accompanied by anxiety, 
 the dream must be concerned with a 
volition which was at one time capable of arousing libido;
 there 
must be a sexual impulse.
 

As for the judgment which is often expressed during a dream: 
Of course, 
 it is only a dream, 
 and the psychic force to which 
it may be ascribed, 
 I shall discuss these questions later on.
 For 
the present I will merely say that they are intended to depreciate 
the importance of what is being dreamed.
 The interesting problem allied to this, 
 as to what is meant if a certain content in the 
dream is characterized in the dream itself as having been 
dreamed — the riddle of a dream within a dream — has been 
solved in a similar sense by W.
 Stekel, 
 by the analysis of some 
convincing examples.
 Here again the part of the dream 
dreamed is to be depreciated in value and robbed of its 
reality;
 that which the dreamer continues to dream after waking 
from the dream within a dream is what the dream-wish desires to put in place of the obliterated reality.
 It may therefore 
be assumed that the part dreamed contains the representation 
of the reality, 
 the real memory, 
 while, 
 on the other hand, 
 the 
continued dream contains the representation of what the dreamer 
merely wishes.
 The inclusion of a certain content in a dream 
within a dream is therefore equivalent to the wish that what 
has been characterized as a dream had never occurred.
 In other 
words: when a particular incident is represented by the dreamwork in a dream, 
 it signifies the strongest confirmation of the 
reality of this incident, 
 the most emphatic affirmation of it.
 The 
dream-work utilizes the dream itself as a form of repudiation, 
 
and thereby confirms the theory that a dream is a wish-fulfilment.
 


D.
 REGARD FOR REPRESENTABILITY 

We have hitherto been concerned with investigating the manner 
in which our dreams represent the relations between the dreamthoughts, 
 but we have often extended our inquiry to the further 
question as to what alterations the dream-material itself undergoes for the purposes of dream-formation.
 We now know that 
the dream-material, 
 after being stripped of a great many of its 
relations, 
 is subjected to compression, 
 while at the same time 
displacements of the intensity of its elements enforce a psychic 
transvaluation of this material.
 The displacements which we 
have considered were shown to be substitutions of one particular idea for another, 
 in some way related to the original by its 
associations, 
 and the displacements were made to facilitate the 
condensation, 
 inasmuch as in this manner, 
 instead of two elements, 
 a common mean between them found its way into the 
dream.
 So far no mention has been made of any other kind of 
displacement.
 But we learn from the analyses that displacement 
of another kind does occur, 
 and that it manifests itself in an 
exchange of the verbal expression for the thought in question.
 In 
both cases we are dealing with a displacement along a chain of 
associations, 
 but the same process takes place in different psychic 
spheres, 
 and the result of this displacement in the one case is 
that one element is replaced by another, 
 while in the other case 
an element exchanges its verbal shape for another.
 

This second kind of displacement occurring in dream-formation is not only of great theoretical interest, 
 but is also peculiarly 
well-fitted to explain the appearance of phantastic absurdity in 
which dreams disguise themselves.
 Displacement usually occurs 
in such a way that a colourless and abstract expression of the' 
dream-thought is exchanged for one that is pictorial and concrete.
 The advantage, 
 and along with it the purpose, 
 of this substitution is obvious.
 Whatever is pictorial is capable oj representation in dreams and can be fitted into a situation in which 
abstract expression would confront the dream-representation 
with difficulties not unlike those which would arise if a political 
leading article had to be represented in an illustrated journal.
 
Not only the possibility of representation, 
 but also the interests 
of condensation and of the censorship, 
 may be furthered by 
this exchange.
 Once the abstractly expressed and unserviceable 
dream-thought is translated into pictorial language, 
 those contacts and identities between this new expression and the rest of 
the dream-material which are required by the dream-work, 
 and 
which it contrives whenever they are not available, 
 are more 
readily provided, 
 since in every language concrete terms, 
 owing 
to their evolution, 
 are richer in associations than are abstract 
terms.
 It may be imagined that a good part of the intermediate 
work in dream-formation, 
 which seeks to reduce the separate 
dream-thoughts to the tersest and most unified expression in the 
dream, 
 is effected in this manner, 
 by fitting paraphrases of the 
various thoughts.
 The one thought whose mode of expression 
has perhaps been determined by other factors will therewith 
exert a distributive and selective influence on the expressions 
available for the others, 
 and it may even do this from the very 
start, 
 just as it would in the creative activity of a poet.
 When a 
poem is to be written in rhymed couplets, 
 the second rhyming 
line is bound by two conditions: it must express the meaning 
allotted to it, 
 and its expression must permit of a rhyme with 
the first line.
 The best poems are, 
 of course, 
 those in which one 
does not detect the effort to find a rhyme, 
 and in which both 
thoughts have as a matter of course, 
 by mutual induction, 
 selected 
the verbal expression which, 
 with a little subsequent adjustment, 
 will permit of the rhymer 

In some cases the change of expression serves the purposes of 
dream-condensation more directly, 
 in that it provides an arrangement of words which, 
 being ambiguous, 
 permits of the 
expression of more than one of the dream-thoughts.
 The whole 
range of verbal wit is thus made to serve the purpose of the 
dream-work.
 The part played by words in dream-formation 
ought not to surprise us.
 A word, 
 as the point of junction of a 
number of ideas, 
 possesses, 
 as it were, 
 a predestined ambiguity, 
 
and the neuroses (obsessions, 
 phobias) take advantage of the 
opportunities for condensation and disguise afforded by words 
quite as eagerly as do dreams.
 21 That dream-distortion also 
profits by this displacement of expression may be readily demonstrated.
 It is indeed confusing if one ambiguous word is substituted for two with single meanings, 
 and the replacement of 
sober, 
 everyday language by a plastic mode of expression baffles 
our understanding, 
 especially since a dream never tells us 
whether the elements presented by it are to be interpreted literally or metaphorically, 
 whether they refer to the dream-material directly, 
 or only by means of interpolated expressions.
 Generally speaking, 
 in the interpretation of any element of a dream 
It is doubtful whether it 

(а) is to be accepted in the negative or the positive sense 
(contrast relation) ;
 

(б) is to be interpreted historically (as a memory) ;
 

(c) is symbolic;
 or whether 

( d ) its valuation is to be based upon its wording.
 

In spite of this versatility, 
 we may say that the representation 
effected by the dream-work, 
 which was never even intended to 
be understood, 
 does not impose upon the translator any greater 
difficulties than those that the ancient writers of hieroglyphics 
imposed upon their readers.
 

I have already given several examples of dream-representations which are held together only by ambiguity of expression 
Zl Cf.
 Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious .
 

(her mouth opens without difficulty, 
 in the dream of Inna's 
injection;
 I cannot go yet after all, 
 in the last dream related, 
 
etc.
) .
 I shall now cite a dream in the analysis of which plastic 
representation of the abstract thoughts plays a greater part.
 
The difference between such dream-interpretation and the interpretation by means of symbols may nevertheless be clearly defined;
 in the symbolic interpretation of dreams the key to the 
symbolism is selected arbitrarily by the interpreter, 
 while in 
our own cases of verbal disguise these keys are universally known 
and are taken from established modes of speech.
 Provided one 
hits on the right idea on the right occasion, 
 one may solve dreams 
of this kind, 
 either completely or in part, 
 independently of any 
statements made by the dreamer.
 

A lady, 
 a friend of mine, 
 dreams: She is at the opera .
 It is a 
Wagnerian performance , 
 which has lasted until 7.
45 in the morning.
 In the stalls and pit there are tables , 
 at which people are 
eating and drinking.
 Her cousin and his young wife , 
 who have 
just returned from their honeymoon , 
 are sitting at one of these 
tables;
 beside them is a member of the aristocracy .
 The young 
wife is said to have brought him back with her from the honeymoon quite openly, 
 just as she might have brought back a hat .
 
In the middle of the stalls there is a high tower ;
 on the top of 1 
which there is a platform surrounded by an iron railing .
 There, 
 
high overhead, 
 stands the conductor, 
 with the features of Hans 
Richter , 
 continually running round behind the railing, 
 perspiring 
terribly;
 and from this position he is conducting the orchestra, 
 
which is arranged round the base of the tower .
 She herself is sitting in a box with a friend of her own sex (known to me).
 Her 
younger sister tries to hand her up, 
 from the stalls, 
 a large lump 
of coal, 
 alleging that she had not known that it would be so long, 
 
and that she must by this time be miserably cold .
 (.
 4 $ though the 
boxes ought to have been heated during the long performance .
) 

Although in other respects the dream gives a good picture of 
the situation, 
 it is, 
 of course, 
 nonsensical enough: the tower in 
the middle of the stalls, 
 from which the conductor leads the 
orchestra, 
 and above all the coal which her sister hands up to 
her.
 I purposely asked for no analysis of this dream.
 With some 
knowledge of the personal relations of the dreamer, 
 I was able 
to interpret parts of it independently of her.
 I knew that she had 
felt intense sympathy for a musician whose career had been 
prematurely brought to an end by insanity.
 I therefore decided 
to take the tower in the stalls verbally .
 It then emerged that 
the man whom she wished to see in the place of Hans Richter 
towered above all the other members of the orchestra.
 This tower 
must be described as a composite formation by means of apposition;
 by its substructure it represents the greatness of the man, 
 
but by the railing at the top, 
 behind which he runs round like a 
prisoner or an animal in a cage (an allusion to the name of the 
unfortunate man ), 
 22 it represents his later fate.
 Lunatic-tower 
is perhaps the expression in which the two thoughts might have 
met.
 

Now that we have discovered the dream's method of representation, 
 we may try, 
 with the same key, 
 to unlock the meaning 
of the second apparent absurdity, 
 that of the coal which her 
sister hands up to the dreamer, 
 Coal should mean secret 
love.
 


No fire, 
 no coal so hotly glows 

As the secret love of which no one knows.
 

She and her friend remain seated while her younger sister, 
 who 
still has a prospect of marrying, 
 hands her up the coal because 
she did not know that it would be so long  What would be so 
long is not told in the dream.
 If it were an anecdote, 
 we should 
say the performance;
 but in the dream we may consider the 
sentence as it is, 
 declare it to be ambiguous, 
 and add before she 
married.
 The interpretation secret love is then confirmed by 
the mention of the cousin who is sitting with his wife in the stalls, 
 
and by the open love-affair attributed to the latter.
 The contrasts between secret and open love, 
 between the dreamer's fire 
and the coldness of the young wife, 
 dominate the dream.
 Moreover, 
 here once again there is a person in a high position as a 
middle term between the aristocrat and the musician who is 
justified in raising high hopes.
 

In the above analysis we have at last brought to light a third 
factor, 
 whose part in the transformation of the dream-thoughts 
into the dream-content is by no means trivial: namely, 
 consideration of the suitability of the dream-thoughts for representation in the particular psychic material of which the dream makes 
use — that is, 
 for the most part in visual images.
 Among the various subordinate ideas associated with the essential dreamthoughts, 
 those will be prefered which permit of visual representation, 
 and the dream-work does not hesitate to recast the 
intractable thoughts into another verbal form, 
 even though this 
is a more unusual form, 
 provided it makes representation possible, 
 and thus puts an end to the psychological distress caused 
by strangulated thinking.
 This pouring of the thought-content 
into another mould may at the same time serve the work of condensation, 
 and may establish relations with another thought 
which otherwise would not have been established.
 It is even possible that this second thought may itself have previously changed 
its original expression for the purpose of meeting the first one 
half-way.
 

Herbert Silberer 24 has described a good method of directly 
observing the transformation of thoughts into images which 
occurs in dream-formation, 
 and has thus made it possible to study 
in isolation this one factor of the dream-work.
 If while in a state 
of fatigue and somnolence he imposed upon himself a mental 
effort, 
 it frequently happened that the thought escaped him, 
 and 
in its place there appeared a picture in which he could recognize 
the substitute for the thought.
 Not quite appropriately, 
 Silberer 
described this substitution as auto-symbolic.
 I shall cite here 
a few examples from Silberer’s work, 
 and on account of certain 
peculiarities of the phenomena observed I shall refer to the subject later on.
 

Example 1.
 — I remember that I have to correct a halting 
passage in an essay.
 

Symbol.
 — I see myself planing a piece of wood.
 

Example 5.
 — I endeavour to call to mind the aim of certain 
metaphysical studies which I am proposing to undertake.
 

This aim, 
 I reflect, 
 consists in working one’s way through, 
 
24 Bleuler-Freud Jahrbuch, 
 i, 
 1909.
 


234 the interpretation of dreams 

while seeking for the basis of existence, 
 to ever higher forms of 
consciousness or levels of being.
 

Symbol .
 — I run a long knife under a cake as though to take 
a slice out of it.
 

Interpretation.
— My movement with the knife signifies 
‘working one’s way through/ .
 .
 .
 The explanation of the basis 
of the symbolism is as follows: At table it devolves upon me now 
and again to cut and distribute a cake, 
 a business which I perform with a long, 
 flexible knife, 
 and which necessitates a certain 
amount of care.
 In particular, 
 the neat extraction of the cut 
slices of cake presents a certain amount of difficulty;
 the knife 
must be carefully pushed under the slices in question (the slow 
‘working one’s way through’ in order to get to the bottom).
 But 
there is yet more symbolism in the picture.
 The cake of the 
symbol was really a ‘dobos-cake’ — that is, 
 a cake in which the 
knife has to cut through several layers (the levels of consciousness and thought).
 

 Example 9.
 — I lost the thread in a train of thought.
 I make 
an effort to find it again, 
 but I have to recognize that the point 
of departure has completely escaped me.
 

Symbol .
 — Part of a form of type, 
 the last lines of which have 
fallen out.
 

In view of the part played by witticisms, 
 puns, 
 quotations, 
 songs, 
 
and proverbs in the intellectual life of educated persons, 
 it would 
be entirely in accordance with our expectations to find disguises 
of this sort used with extreme frequency in the representation 
of the dream-thoughts.
 Only in the case of a few types of material has a generally valid dream-symbolism established itself 
on the basis of generally known allusions and verbal equivalents.
 
A good part of this symbolism, 
 however, 
 is common to the psychoneuroses, 
 legends, 
 and popular usages as well as to dreams.
 

In fact, 
 if we look more closely into the matter, 
 we must recognize that in employing this kind of substitution the dream-work 
is doing nothing at all original.
 For the achievement of its purpose, 
 which in this case is representation without interference 
from the censorship, 
 it simply follows the paths which it finds 
already marked out in unconscious thinking, 
 and gives the preference 
to those transformations of the repressed material which 
are permitted to become conscious also in the form of witticisms 
and allusions, 
 and with which all the phantasies of neurotics 
are replete.
 Here we suddenly begin to understand the dreaminterpretations of Schemer, 
 whose essential correctness I have 
vindicated elsewhere.
 The preoccupation of the imagination with 
one’s own body is by no means peculiar to or characteristic of 
the dream alone.
 My analyses have shown me that it is constantly found in the unconscious thinking of neurotics, 
 and may 
be traced back to sexual curiosity, 
 whose object, 
 in the adolescent youth or maiden, 
 is the genitals of the opposite sex, 
 or even 
of the same sex.
 But, 
 as Schemer and Volkelt very truly insist, 
 
the house does not constitute the only group of ideas which is 
employed for the symbolization of the body, 
 either in dreams or 
in the unconscious phantasies of neurosis.
 To be sure, 
 I know 
patients who have steadily adhered to an architectural symbolism for the body and the genitals (sexual interest, 
 of course, 
 extends far beyond the region of the external genital organs) — 
patients for whom posts and pillars signify legs (as in the Song 
of Songs ) , 
 to whom every door suggests a bodily aperture 
(‘‘hole), 
 and every waterpipe the urinary system, 
 and so on.
 
But the groups of ideas appertaining to plant-life, 
 or to the 
kitchen, 
 are just as often chosen to conceal sexual images ;
 25 in 
respect of the former everyday language, 
 the sediment of imaginative comparisons dating from the remotest times, 
 has abundantly paved the way (the vineyard of the Lord, 
 the seed of 
Abraham, 
 the garden of the maiden in the Song of Songs).
 
The ugliest as well as the most intimate details of sexual life may 
be thought or dreamed of in apparently innocent allusions to 
culinary operations, 
 and the symptoms of hysteria will become 
absolutely unintelligible if we forget that sexual symbolism may 
conceal itself behind the most commonplace and inconspicuous 
matters as its safest hiding-place.
 That some neurotic children 
cannot look at blood and raw meat, 
 that they vomit at the 
sight of eggs and macaroni, 
 and that the dread of snakes, 
 which 
is natural to mankind, 
 is monstrously exaggerated in neurotics 
— all this has a definite sexual meaning.
 Wherever the neurosis 
employs a disguise of this sort, 
 it treads the paths once trodden 
by the whole of humanity in the early stages of civilization — 
paths to whose thinly veiled existence our idiomatic expressions, 
 
proverbs, 
 superstitions, 
 and customs testify to this day.
 

I here insert the promised flower-dream 55 of a female patient, 
 
in which I shall print in Roman type everything which is to be 
sexually interpreted.
 This beautiful dream lost all its charm for 
the dreamer once it had been interpreted.
 

( 1 a ) Preliminary dream: She goes to the two maids in the 
kitchen and scolds them for taking so long to prepare a little bite 
of food  She also sees a very large number of heavy kitchen 
utensils in the kitchen, 
 heaped into piles and turned upside down 
in order to drain .
 Later addition: The two maids go to fetch 
water, 
 and have , 
 as it were, 
 to climb into a river which reaches 
up to the house or into the courtyard 26 

(b) Main dream : 27 She is descending from a height 28 over 
curiously constructed railings , 
 or a fence which is composed of 
large square trellis-work hurdles with small square apertures , 
 29 
It is really not adapted for climbing;
 she is constantly afraid that 
she cannot find a place for her foot, 
 and she is glad that her dress 
doesn’t get caught anywhere, 
 and that she is able to climb down 
it so respectably .
 30 As she climbs she is carrying a big branch 
in her hand ? 1 really like a tree, 
 which is thickly studded with 
red flowers;
 a spreading branch, 
 with many twigs ? 2 With this is 
connected the idea 0} cherry-blossoms (Bliiten = flowers) , 
 but 
they look like fully opened camellias, 
 which of course do not 
grow on trees .
 As she is descending , 
 she first has one, 
 then suddenly two, 
 and then again only one? z When she has reached the 
ground the lower flowers have already begun to fall.
 Now that she 
has reached the bottom she sees an  odd man  who is combing — 
as she woidd like to put it — just such a tree, 
 that is, 
 with a piece 
of wood he is scraping thick bunches of hair from it, 
 which hang 
from it like moss .
 Other men have chopped off such branches in a 
garden, 
 and have flung them into the road, 
 where they are lying 
about, 
 so that a number of people take some of them .
 But she 
asks whether this is right, 
 whether she may take one, 
 too ?* In 
the garden there stands a young man ( he is a foreigner, 
 and known 
to her) toward whom she goes in order to ask him how it is possible to transplant such branches in her own garden .
 35 He embraces her, 
 whereupon she struggles and asks him what he is 
thinking of, 
 whether it is permissible to embrace her in such a 
manner .
 He says there is nothing wrong in it, 
 that it is permitted?* He then declares himself willing to go with her into the 
other garden, 
 in order to show her how to put them in, 
 and he 
says something to her which she does not quite understand: u Besides this I need three metres {later she says: square metres) or 
three fathoms of ground It seems as though he were asking her 
for something in return for his willingness, 
 as though he had the 
intention of indemnifying (reimbursing) himself in her garden, 
 
as though he wanted to evade some law or other, 
 to derive some 
advantage from it without causing her an injury .
 She does not 
know whether or not he really shows her anything , 
 , 
 

The above dream, 
 which has been given prominence on account of its symbolic elements, 
 may be described as a biographical 
dream.
 Such dreams occur frequently in psychoanalysis, 
 but 
perhaps only rarely outside it .
 37 

I have, 
 of course, 
 an abundance of such material, 
 but to reproduce it here would lead us too far into the consideration of 
neurotic conditions.
 Everything points to the same conclusion, 
 
namely, 
 that we need not assume that any special symbolizing 
activity of the psyche is operative in dream-formation;
 that, 
 on 
the contrary, 
 the dream makes use of such symbolizations as are 
to be found ready-made in unconscious thinking, 
 since these, 
 by 
reason of their ease of representation, 
 and for the most part by 
reason of their being exempt from the censorship, 
 satisfy more 
effectively the requirements of dream-formation.
 

E.
 REPRESENTATION IN DREAMS BY SYMBOLS: SOME FURTHER 
TYPICAL DREAMS 

The analysis of the last biographical dream shows that I recognized the symbolism in dreams from the very outset.
 But it was 
only little by little that I arrived at a full appreciation of its 
extent and significance, 
 as the result of increasing experience, 
 
and under the influence of the works of W.
 Stekel, 
 concerning 
which I may here fittingly say something.
 

This author, 
 who has perhaps injured psychoanalysis as much 
as he has benefited it, 
 produced a large number of novel symbolic translations, 
 to which no credence was given at first, 
 but 
most of which were later confirmed and had to be accepted.
 
Stekel’s services are in no way belittled by the remark that the 
sceptical reserve with which these symbols were received was 
not unjustified.
 For the examples upon which he based his interpretations were often unconvincing, 
 and, 
 moreover, 
 he employed 
a method which must be rejected as scientifically unreliable.
 
Stekel found his symbolic meanings by way of intuition, 
 by virtue of his individual faculty of immediately understanding the 
symbols.
 But such an art cannot be generally assumed;
 its efficiency is immune from criticism, 
 and its results have therefore 
no claim to credibility.
 It is as though one were to base one’s 
diagnosis of infections diseases on the olfactory impressions received beside the sick-bed, 
 although of course there have been 
clinicians to whom the sense of smell — atrophied in most people 
— has been of greater service than to others, 
 and who really have 
been able to diagnose a case of abdominal typhus by their sense 
of smell.
 

The progressive experience of psychoanalysis has enabled us 
to discover patients who have displayed in a surprising degree 
this immediate understanding of dream-symbolism.
 Many of 
these patients suffered from dementia praecox, 
 so that for a 
time there was an inclination to suspect that all dreamers with 
such an understanding of symbols were suffering from that disorder.
 But this did not prove to be the case;
 it is simply a question of a personal gift or idiosyncrasy without perceptible 
pathological significance.
 

When one has familiarized oneself with the extensive employment of symbolism for the representation of sexual material in 
dreams, 
 one naturally asks oneself whether many of these symbols have not a permanently established meaning, 
 like the signs 
in shorthand;
 and one even thinks of attempting to compile a 
new dream-book on the lines of the cipher method.
 In this connection it should be noted that symbolism does not appertain 
especially to dreams, 
 but rather to the unconscious imagination, 
 
and particularly to that of the people, 
 and it is to be found in a 
more developed condition in folklore, 
 myths, 
 legends, 
 idiomatic 
phrases, 
 proverbs, 
 and the current witticisms of a people than 
in dreams.
 We should have, 
 therefore, 
 to go far beyond the 
province of dream-interpretation in order fully to investigate 
the meaning of symbolism, 
 and to discuss the numerous problems — for the most part still unsolved — which are associated 
with the concept of the symbol / 58 We shall here confine ourselves 
to say that representation by a symbol comes under the heading 
of the indirect representations, 
 but that we are warned by all 
sorts of signs against indiscriminately classing symbolic representation with the other modes of indirect representation before 
we have clearly conceived its distinguishing characteristics.
 In 
a number of cases the common quality shared by the symbol and 
the thing which it represents is obvious, 
 in others it is concealed;
 
in these latter cases the choice of the symbol appears to be enigmatic.
 And these are the very cases that must be able to elucidate the ultimate meaning of the symbolic relation;
 they point 
to the fact that it is of a genetic nature.
 What is to-day symbolically connected was probably united, 
 in primitive times, 
 by 
conceptual and linguistic identity.
 39 The symbolic relationship 
seems to be a residue and reminder of a former identity.
 It may 
also be noted that in many cases the symbolic identity extends 
beyond the linguistic identity, 
 as had already been asserted by 
Schubert (1814).
 40 

Dreams employ this symbolism to give a disguised representation to their latent thoughts.
 Among the symbols thus employed there are, 
 of course, 
 many which constantly, 
 or all but 
constantly, 
 mean the same thing.
 But we must bear in mind the 
curious plasticity of psychic material.
 Often enough a symbol in 
the dream-content may have to be interpreted not symbolically 
but in accordance with its proper meaning;
 at other times the 
dreamer, 
 having to deal with special memory-material, 
 may 
take the law into his own hands and employ anything whatever 
as a sexual symbol, 
 though it is not generally so employed.
 
Wherever he has the choice of several symbols for the representation of a dream-content, 
 he will decide in favour of that symbol 
which is in addition objectively related to his other thoughtmaterial;
 that is to say, 
 he will employ an individual motivation 
besides the typically valid one.
 

Although since Schemer’s time the more recent investigations 
of dream-problems have definitely established the existence of 
dream-symbolism — even Havelock Ellis acknowledges that our 
dreams are indubitably full of symbols — it must yet be admitted 
that the existence of symbols in dreams has not only facilitated 
dream-interpretation, 
 but has also made it more difficult.
 The 
technique of interpretation in accordance with the dreamer’s 
free associations more often than otherwise leaves us in the 
lurch as far as the symbolic elements of the dream-content are 
concerned.
 A return to the arbitrariness of dream-interpretation 
as it was practised in antiquity, 
 and is seemingly revived by 
StekePs wild interpretations, 
 is contrary to scientific method.
 
Consequently, 
 those elements in the dream-content which are to 
be symbolically regarded compel us to employ a combined technique, 
 which on the one hand is based on the dreamer’s associations, 
 while on the other hand the missing portions have to be 
supplied by the interpreter’s understanding of the symbols.
 
Critical circumspection in the solution of the symbols must coincide with careful study of the symbols in especially transparent 
examples of dreams in order to silence the reproach of arbitrariness in dream-interpretation.
 The uncertainties which still adhere to our function as dream-interpreters are due partly to our 
imperfect knowledge (which, 
 however, 
 can be progressively increased) and partly to certain peculiarities of the dream-symbols themselves.
 These often possess many and varied meanings, 
 
so that, 
 as in Chinese script, 
 only the context can furnish the 
correct meaning.
 This multiple significance of the symbol is 
allied to the dream’s faculty of admitting over-interpretations, 
 
of representing, 
 in the same content, 
 various wish-impulses and 
thought-formations, 
 often of a widely divergent character.
 

After these limitations and reservations I will proceed.
 The 
Emperor and the Empress (King and Queen ) 41 in most cases 
really represent the dreamer’s parents;
 the dreamer himself or 
herself is the prince or princess.
 But the high authority conceded to the Emperor is also conceded to great men, 
 so that in 
some dreams, 
 for example, 
 Goethe appears as a father-symbol 
(Hitschmann).
 — All elongated objects, 
 jticks, 
 tree-trunks, 
 umbrellas (on account of the opening, 
 which might be likened to an 
erection), 
 all sharp and elongated weapons, 
 knives, 
 daggers, 
 and 
pikes, 
 represent the male member.
 A frequent, 
 but not very intelligible symbol for the same is a nail-file (a reference to rubbing 
and scraping?) .
 — Small boxes, 
 chests, 
 cupboards, 
 and ovens correspond to the female organ;
 also cavities, 
 ships, 
 and all kinds 
of vessels.
 — A room in a dream generally represents a woman;
 
the description of its various entrances and exits is scarcely 
calculated to make us doubt this interpretation .
 42 The interest 
as to whether the room is open or locked will be readily 
understood in this connection.
 (Cf.
 Dora’s dream in Fragment 
of an Analysis of Hysteria .
) There is no need to be explicit as to 
the sort of key that will unlock the room;
 the symbolism of 
lock and key has been gracefully if broadly employed by 
Uhland in his song of the Graf Ebersiein .
 — The dream of walking through a suite of rooms signifies a brothel or a harem.
 But, 
 
as H.
 Sachs has shown by an admirable example, 
 it is also employed to represent marriage (contrast).
 An interesting relation 
to the sexual investigations of childhood emerges when the 
dreamer dreams of two rooms which were previously one, 
 or 
finds that a familiar room in a house of which he dreams has 
been divided into two, 
 or the reverse.
 In childhood the female 
genitals and anus (the behind 43 ) are conceived of as a single 

d2 A patient living in a boarding-house dreams that he meets one of the 
servants, 
 and asks her what her number is;
 to his surprise she answers: 14.
 
He has in fact entered into relations with the girl in question, 
 and has often 
had her in his bedroom.
 She feared, 
 as may be imagined, 
 that the landlady 
suspected her, 
 and had proposed, 
 on the day before the dream, 
 that they 
should meet in one of the unoccupied rooms.
 In reality this room had the 
number 14, 
 while in the dream the woman bore this number.
 A dearer 
proof of the identification of woman and room could hardly be imagined.

THE DREAM-WORK 


243 

opening according to the infantile cloaca theory, 
 and only later 
is it discovered that this region of the body contains two separate 
cavities and openings.
 Steep inclines, 
 ladders, 
 and stairs, 
 and 
going up or down them, 
 are symbolic representations of the sexual act .
 44 Smooth walls over which one climbs, 
 facades of houses, 
 
across which one lets oneself down — often with a sense of great 
anxiety — correspond to erect human bodies, 
 and probably repeat in our dreams childish memories of climbing up parents or 
nurses.
 Smooth walls are men;
 in anxiety dreams one often 
holds firmly to projections on houses.
 Tables, 
 whether bare or 
covered, 
 and boards, 
 are women, 
 perhaps by virtue of contrast, 
 
since they have no protruding contours.
 Wood, 
 generally 
speaking, 
 seems, 
 in accordance with its linguistic relations, 
 to 
represent feminine matter ( Materie ) .
 The name of the island 
Madeira means wood in Portuguese.
 Since bed and board 
( mensa et thorns) constitute marriage, 
 in dreams the latter is 
often substituted for the former, 
 and as far as practicable the 
sexual representation-complex is transposed to the eating-complex.
 — Of articles of dress, 
 a woman’s hat may very often be 
interpreted with certainty as the male genitals.
 In the dreams 
of men one often finds the necktie as a symbol for the penis;
 this 
is not only because neckties hang down in front of the body, 
 and 
are characteristic of men, 
 but also because one can select them 
at pleasure, 
 a freedom which nature prohibits as regards the 
original of the symbol.
 Persons who make use of this symbol in 
dreams are very extravagant in the matter of ties, 
 and possess 
whole collections of them .
 45 All complicated machines and appliances are very probably the genitals — as a rule the male 
genitals — in the description of which the symbolism of dreams 
is as indefatigable as human wit.
 It is quite unmistakable that 
all weapons and tools are used as symbols for the male organ: 
e.
g.
 ploughshare, 
 hammer, 
 gun, 
 revolver, 
 dagger, 
 sword, 
 etc.
 
Again, 
 many of the landscapes seen in dreams, 
 especially those 
that contain bridges or wooded mountains, 
 may be readily 
recognized as descriptions of the genitals.
 Marcinowski collected 
a series of examples in which the dreamer explained his dream 
by means of drawings, 
 in order to represent the landscapes and 
places appearing in it.
 These drawings clearly showed the distinction between the manifest and the latent meaning of the 
dream.
 Whereas, 
 naively regarded, 
 they seemed to represent 
plans, 
 maps, 
 and so forth, 
 closer investigation showed that they 
were representations of the human body, 
 of the genitals, 
 etc.
, 
 
and only after conceiving them thus could the dream be understood .
 46 Finally, 
 where one finds incomprehensible neologisms 
one may suspect combinations of components having a sexual 
significance.

 too,

 referring to their 
genital organs as little man, 
 little woman, 
 little thing  
The little brother was correctly recognized by Stekel as the 
penis.
 To play with or to beat a little child is often the dream’s 
representation of masturbation.
 The dream-work represents 
castration by baldness, 
 hair-cutting, 
 the loss of teeth, 
 and beheading.
 
As an insurance against castration, 
 the dream uses one 
of the common symbols of a penis in double or multiple form;
 
and the appearance in a dream of a lizard — an animal whose 
tail, 
 if pulled off, 
 is regenerated by a new growth — has the same 
meaning.
 Most of those animals which are utilized as genital 
symbols in mythology and folklore play this part also in dreams: 
the fish, 
 the snail, 
 the cat, 
 the mouse (on account of the hairiness of the genitals), 
 but above all the snake, 
 which is the most 
important symbol of the male member.
 Small animals and vermin are substitutes for little children, 
 e.
g.
 undesired sisters or 
brothers.
 To be infected with vermin is often the equivalent for 
pregnancy.
 — As a very recent symbol of the male organ I may 
mention the airship, 
 whose employment is justified by its relation to flying, 
 and also, 
 occasionally, 
 by its form.
 — Stekel has 
given a number of other symbols, 
 not yet sufficiently verified, 
 
which he has illustrated by examples.
 The works of this author, 
 
and especially his book: Die Sprache des Traumes, 
 contain the 
richest collection of interpretations of symbols, 
 some of which 
were ingeniously guessed and were proved to be correct upon 
investigation, 
 as, 
 for example, 
 in the section on the symbolism 
of death.
 The author’s lack of critical reflection, 
 and his tendency to generalize at all costs, 
 make his interpretations doubtful or inapplicable, 
 so that in making use of his works caution 
is urgently advised.
 I shall therefore restrict myself to mentioning a few examples.
 

Right and left, 
 according to Stekel, 
 are to be understood in 
dreams in an ethical sense.
 The right-hand path always signifies 
the way to righteousness, 
 the left-hand path the path to crime.
 
Thus the left may signify homosexuality, 
 incest, 
 and perversion, 
 
while the right signifies marriage, 
 relations with a prostitute, 
 
etc.
 The meaning is always determined by the individual moral 
standpoint of the dreamer (loc.
 cit.
, 
 p.
 466).
 Relatives in 
dreams generally stand for the genitals (p.
 373 ff.
).
 Here I can 
confirm this meaning only for the son, 
 the daughter, 
 and the 
younger sister — that is, 
 wherever little thing could be employed.
 On the other hand, 
 verified examples allow us to recognize sisters as symbols of the breasts, 
 and brothers as symbols 
of the larger hemispheres.
 To be unable to overtake a carriage 
is interpreted by Stekel as regret at being unable to catch up 
with a difference in age (p.
 479).
 The luggage of a traveller is 
the burden of sin by whic]x.
Dne is oppressed {ibid.
).
 But a 
.
 travellers luggage often proves to be an unmistakable symbol 
f of one’s own genitals.
 To numbers, 
 which frequently occur in 
dreams, 
 Stekel has assignedaffixed symbolic meaning, 
 but these 
interpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of universal 
validity, 
 although in individual cases they can usually be recognized as plausible.
 We have, 
 at all events, 
 abundant confirmation that the figure three is a symbol of the male genitals.
 One 
of StekePs generalizations refers to the double meaning of the 
genital symbols.
 Where is there a symbol, 
’ 5 he asks, 
 which 
(if in any way permitted by the imagination) may not be used 
simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense? To 
be sure, 
 the clause in parenthesis retracts much of the absolute 
character of this assertion, 
 for this double meaning is not always 
permitted by the imagination.
 Still, 
 I think it is not superfluous 
to state that in my experience this general statement of StekePs 
requires elaboration.
 Besides those symbols which are just as 
frequently employed for the male as for the female genitals, 
 
there are others which preponderantly, 
 or almost exclusively, 
 
designate one of the sexes, 
 and there are yet others which, 
 so far 
as we know, 
 have only the male or only the female signification.
 
To use long, 
 stiff objects and weapons as symbols of the female 
genitals, 
 or hollow objects (chests, 
 boxes, 
 etc.
) as symbols of the 
male genitals, 
 is certainly not permitted by the imagination.
 

It is true that the tendency of dreams, 
 and of the unconscious 
phantasy, 
 to employ the sexual symbols bisexually, 
 reveals an 
archaic trait, 
 for in childhood the difference in the genitals is 
unknown, 
 and the same genitals are attributed to both sexes.
 
One may also be misled as regards the significance of a bisexual 
symbol if one forgets the fact that in some dreams a general reversal of sexes takes takes place, 
 so that the male organ is represented by the female, 
 and vice versa .
 Such dreams express, 
 for 
example, 
 the wish of a woman to be a man.
 

The genitals may even be represented in dreams by other 
parts of the body: the male member by the hand or the foot, 
 the 
female genital orifice by the mouth, 
 the ear, 
 or even the eye.
 

The secretions of the human body — mucus, 
 tears, 
 urine, 
 semen, 
 
etc.
 — may be used in dreams interchangeably.
 This statement 
of Stekel’s, 
 correct in the main, 
 has suffered a justifiable critical 
restriction as the result of certain comments of R.
 Reitier’s 
{Internal.
 Zeitschr .
 fur Psych.
, 
 i, 
 1913).
 The gist of the matter 
is the replacement of an important secretion, 
 such as the semen, 
 
by an indifferent one.
 

These very incomplete indications may suffice to stimulate 
others to make a more painstaking collection.
 47 1 have attempted 
a much more detailed account of dream-symbolism in my Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (trans.
 by Joan Riviere.
 
Allen & Unwin, 
 London).
 

I shall now append a few instances of the use of such symbols, 
 
which will show how impossible it is to arrive at the interpretation of a dream if one excludes dream-symbolism, 
 but also how 
in many cases it is imperatively forced upon one.
 At the same 
time, 
 I must expressly warn the investigator against overestimating the importance of symbols in the interpretation of 
dreams, 
 restricting the work of dream-translation to the translation of symbols, 
 and neglecting the technique of utilizing the 
associations of the dreamer.
 The two techniques of dream-interpretation must supplement one another;
 practically, 
 however, 
 
as well as theoretically, 
 precedence is retained by the latter 
process, 
 which assigns the final significance to the utterances of 
the dreamer, 
 while the symbol-translations which we undertake 
play an auxiliary part.
 

1.
 The hat as the symbol of a man (of the male genitals) : 48 
(A fragment from the dream of a young woman who suffered 
from agoraphobia as the result of her fear of temptation.
) 

"7 am walking in the street in summer;
 I am wearing a straw 
hat of peculiar shape , 
 the middle piece of which is bent upwards , 
 
while the side pieces hang downwards { here the description hesitotes), 
 
and in such a fashion that one hangs lower than the 
other .
 I am cheerful and in a confident mood, 
 and as I pass a 
number of young officers I think to myself: You can’t do anything to me 

As she could produce no associations to the hat, 
 I said to her: 
The hat is really a male genital organ, 
 with its raised middle 
piece and the two downward-hanging side pieces.
 It is perhaps 
peculiar that her hat should be supposed to be a man, 
 but alter 
all one says: Unter die Eaube kommen (to get under the cap) 
when we mean: to get married.
 I intentionally refrained from 
interpreting the details concerning the unequal dependence of 
the two side pieces, 
 although the determination of just such details must point the way to the interpretation.
 I went on to say 
that if, 
 therefore, 
 she had a husband with such splendid genitals 
she would not have to fear the officers;
 that is, 
 she would have 
nothing to wish from them, 
 for it was essentially her temptationphantasies which prevented her from going about unprotected 
and unaccompanied.
 This last explanation of her anxiety I had 
already been able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other 
material.
 

It is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this 
interpretation.
 She withdrew her description of the hat, 
 and 
would not admit that she had said that the two side pieces were 
hanging down.
 I was, 
 however, 
 too sure of what I had heard to 
allow myself to be misled, 
 and so I insisted that she did say it.
 
She was quiet for a while, 
 and then found the courage to ask 
why it was that one of her husband’s testicles was lower than 
the other, 
 and whether it was the same with all men.
 With this 
the peculiar detail of the hat was explained, 
 and the whole interpretation was accepted by her.
 

The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the patient 
related this dream.
 From other but less transparent cases I believed that I might assume the hat could also stand for the 
female genitals .

2.
 The little one as the genital organ.
 Being run over as a 
symbol of sexual intercourse.
 

(Another dream of the same agoraphobic patient.
) 

Eer mother sends away her little daughter so that she has 
to go alone.
 She then drives with her mother to the railway station , 
 and sees her little one walking right along the track , 
 so that 
she is bound to be run over .
 She hears the bones crack .
 (At this 
she experiences a feeling of discomfort but no real horror .
) She 
then looks out through the carriage window } to see whether the 
parts cannot be seen behind .
 Then she reproaches her mother 
for allowing the little one to go out alone 

Analysis.
 — It is not an easy matter to give here a complete 
interpretation of the dream.
 It forms part of a cycle of dreams, 
 
and can be fully understood only in connection with the rest.
 
For it is not easy to obtain the material necessary to demonstrate the symbolism in a sufficiently isolated condition.
 The 
patient at first finds that the railway journey is to be interpreted 
historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium for 
nervous diseases, 
 with whose director she was of course in love.
 
Her mother fetched her away, 
 and before her departure the 
physician came the the railway station and gave her a bunch of 
flowers;
 she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed 
this attention.
 Here the mother, 
 therefore, 
 appears as the disturber of her tender feelings, 
 a role actually played by this strict 
woman during her daughter’s girlhood.
 — The next association 
referred to the sentence: She then looks to see whether the 
parts cannot be seen behind.
 In the dream-fagade one would 
naturally be compelled to think of the pieces of the little daughter who had been run over and crushed.
 The association, 
 however, 
 turns in quite a different direction.
 She recalls that she 
once saw her father in the bath-room, 
 naked, 
 from behind;
 she 
then begins to talk about sex differences, 
 and remarks that in 
the man the genitals can be seen from behind, 
 but in the woman 
they cannot.
 In this connection she now herself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital organ, 
 and her little 
one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own organ.
 She reproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had 
no genitals, 
 and recognizes this reproach in the introductory 
sentence of the dream: the mother sends her little one away, 
 so 
that she has to go alone.
 In her phantasy, 
 going alone through 
the streets means having no man, 
 no sexual relations (coire = 
to go together), 
 and this she does not like.
 According to all her 
statements, 
 she really suffered as a girl through her mother’s 
jealousy, 
 because her father showed a preference for her.
 

The deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another 
dream of the same night, 
 in which the dreamer identifies herself 
with her brother.
 She was a tomboy, 
 and was always being 
told that she should have been born a boy.
 This identification 
with the brother shows with especial clearness that the little 
one signifies the genital organ.
 The mother threatened him 
(her) with castration, 
 which could only be understood as a 
punishment for playing with the genital parts, 
 and the identification, 
 therefore, 
 shows that she herself had masturbated as a 
child, 
 though she had retained only a memory of her brother’s 
having done so.
 An early knowledge of the male genitals, 
 which 
she lost later, 
 must, 
 according to the assertions of this second 
dream, 
 have been acquired at this time.
 Moreover, 
 the second 
dream points to the infantile sexual theory that girls originate 
from boys as a result of castration.
 After I had told her of this 
childish belief, 
 she at once confirmed it by an anecdote in which 
the boy asks the girl: Was it cut off? to which the girl replies: 
No, 
 it’s always been like that.
 

Consequently the sending away of the little one, 
 of the 
genital organ, 
 in the first dream refers also to the threatened 
castration.
 Finally, 
 she blames her mother for not having borne 
her as a boy.
 

That being run over symbolizes sexual intercourse would 
not be evident from this dream if we had not learned it from 
many other sources.

 Representation of the genitals by buildings, 
 stairs, 
 and 
shafts.
 

(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.
) 

He is taking a walk with his father in a place which is certainly the Prater , 
 for one can see the Rotunda , 
 in front of which 
there is a small vestibule to which there is attached a captive 
balloon;
 the balloon , 
 however, 
 seems rather limp.
 His father 
asks him what this is all for;
 he is surprised at it, 
 but he explains it to his father .
 They come into a courtyard in which lies 
a large sheet of tin .
 His father wants to pull off a big piece of 
this, 
 but first looks round to see if anyone is watching.
 He tells 
his father that all he needs to do- is to speak to the overseer , 
 and 
then he can take as much as he wants to without any more ado .
 
From this courtyard a flight of stairs leads down into a shaft , 
 
the walls of which are softly upholstered, 
 rather like a leather 
arm-chair .
 At the end of this shaft there is a long platform , 
 and 
then a new shaft begins .
 .
 

Analysis.
 — -This dreamer belonged to a type of patient which 
is not at all promising from a therapeutic point of view;
 up to a 
certain point in the analysis such patients offer no resistance 
whatever, 
 but from that point onwards they prove to be almost 
inaccessible.
 This dream he analysed almost independently, 
 
‘‘The Rotunda, 
 he said, 
 is my genitals, 
 the captive balloon in 
front is my penis, 
 about whose fiaccidity I have been worried.
 
We must, 
 however, 
 interpret it in greater detail: the Rotunda is 
the buttocks, 
 constantly associated by the child with the genitals;
 the smaller structure in front is the scrotum.
 In the dream 
his father asks him what this is all for — that is, 
 he asks him 
about the purpose and arrangement of the genitals.
 It is quite 
evident that this state of affairs should be reversed, 
 and that he 
ought to be the questioner.
 As such questioning on the part of 
the father never occurred in reality, 
 we must conceive the 
dream-thought as a wish, 
 or perhaps take it conditionally, 
 as 
follows.
 If I had asked my father for sexual enlightenment .
 .
 
The continuation of this thought we shall presently find in 
another place.
 

The courtyard in which the sheet of tin is spread out is not to 
be conceived symbolically in the first instance, 
 but originates 
from his father’s place of business.
 For reasons of discretion I 
have inserted the tin for another material in which the father 
deals without, 
 however, 
 changing anything in the verbal expression of the dream.
 The dreamer had entered his father’s business, 
 and had taken a terrible dislike to the somewhat questionable practices upon which its profit mainly depended.
 Hence the 
continuation of the above dream-thought (if I had asked him) 
would be: He would have deceived me just as he does his customers  For the pulling off, 
 which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, 
 the dreamer himself gives a second explanation, 
 namely, 
 masturbation.
 This is not only quite familiar to us 
(see above, 
 p.
 237), 
 but agrees very well with the fact that the 
secrecy of masturbation is expressed by its opposite (one can do 
it quite openly).
 Thus, 
 it agrees entirely with our expectations 
that the auto-erotic activity should be attributed to the father, 
 
just as was the questioning in the first scene of the dream.
 The 
shaft he at once interprets as the vagina, 
 by referring to the soft 
upholstering of the walls.
 That the action of coition in the vagina 
is described as a going down instead of in the usual way as a going up agrees with what I have found in other instances.
 50 

The details — that at the end of the first shaft there is a long 
platform, 
 and then a new shaft — he himself explains biographically.
 He had for some time had sexual intercourse with women, 
 
but had given it up on account of inhibitions, 
 and now hopes to 
be able to begin it again with the aid of the treatment.
 The 
dream, 
 however, 
 becomes indistinct towards the end, 
 and to the 
experienced interpreter it becomes evident that in the second 
scene of the dream the influence of another subject has already 
begun to assert itself ;
 which is indicated by his father’s business, 
 
his dishonest practices, 
 and the vagina represented by the first 
shaft, 
 so that one may assume a reference to his mother.

 A modified staircase dream.
 

To one of my patients, 
 a sexual abstainer, 
 who was very ill, 
 
whose phantasy was fixated upon his mother, 
 and who repeatedly 
dreamed of climbing stairs while accompanied by his mother, 
 I 
once remarked that moderate masturbation would probably 
have been less harmful to him than his enforced abstinence.
 The 
influence of this remark provoked the following dream: 

His piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his pianoplaying, 
 and for not practicing the fctudes of Moscheles and 
dementi’s Gradus ad Pamassum.
 With reference to this he remarked that the Gradus, 
 too, 
 is a stairway, 
 and that the piano 
itself is a stairway, 
 as it has a scale.
 

It may be said that there is no class of ideas which cannot be 
enlisted in the representation of sexual facts and wishes.

 The Sensation of Reality and the Representation of Repetition.
 

54 Crines pubis.
 

c5 Demons in cloaks and hoods are, 
 according to the explanation of a specialist, 
 of a phallic character.
 

56 The two halves of the scrotum.
 

A man, 
 now thirty-five, 
 relates a clearly remembered dream 
which he claims to have had when he was four years of age: The 
notary with whom his father’s will was deposited — he had lost 
his father at the age of three — brought two large Emperor-pears, 
 
of which he was given one to eat .
 The other lay on the windowsill of the living-room .
 He woke with the conviction of the reality 
of what he had dreamt, 
 and obstinately asked his mother to give 
him the second pear;
 it was, 
 he said, 
 still lying on the windowsill.
 His mother laughed at this.
 

Analysis.
 — The notary was a jovial old gentleman who, 
 as he 
seems to remember, 
 really sometimes brought pears with him.
 
The window-sill was as he saw it in the dream.
 Nothing else 
occurs to him in this connection, 
 except, 
 perhaps, 
 that his mother 
has recently told him a dream.
 She has two birds sitting on her 
head;
 she wonders when they will fly away, 
 but they do not fly 
away, 
 and one of them flies to her mouth and sucks at it.
 

The dreamer’s inability to furnish associations justifies the 
attempt to interpret it by the substitution of symbols.
 The two 
pears — pommes ou poires — are the breasts of the mother who 
nursed him;
 the window-sill is the projection of the bosom, 
 
analogous to the balconies in the dream of houses.
 His sensation 
of reality after waking is justified, 
 for his mother had actually 
suckled him for much longer than the customary term, 
 and her 
breast was still available.
 The dream is to be translated: 
Mother, 
 give (show) me the breast again at which I once used 
to drink.
 The once is represented by the eating of the one 
pear, 
 the again by the desire for the other.
 The temporal 
repetition of an act is habitually represented in dreams by the 
numerical multiplication of an object .
 

It is naturally a very striking phenomenon that symbolism 
should already play a part in the dream of a child of four, 
 but 
this is the rule rather than the exception.
 One may say that the 
dreamer has command of symbolism from the very first.
 

The early age at which people make use of symbolic representation, 
 even apart from the dream-life, 
 may be shown by 
the following uninfluenced memory of a lady who is now twentyseven: She is in her fourth year .
 The nursemaid is driving her , 
 
with her brother, 
 eleven months younger t and a cousin, 
 who is 
between the two in age , 
 to the lavatory , 
 so that they can do their 
little business there before going for their walk .
 As the oldest , 
 
she sits on the seat and the other two on chambers .
 She asks her 
( female ) cousin: Have you a purse , 
 too? Walter has a little 
sausage , 
 I have a purse .
 The cousin answers: Yes , 
 I have a purse, 
 
too .
 The nursemaid listens, 
 laughing, 
 and relates the conversation to the mother, 
 whose reaction is a sharp reprimand .
 

Here a dream may be inserted whose excellent symbolism 
permitted of interpretation with little assistance from the 
dreamer: 

8.
 The Question of Symbolism in the Dreams of Normal 
Persons.
 57 

An objection frequently raised by the opponents of psychoanalysis — and recently also by Havelock Ellis 58 — is that, 
 although dream-symbolism may perhaps be a product of the neurotic psyche, 
 it has no validity whatever in the case of normal 
persons.
 But while psychoanalysis recognizes no essential distinctions, 
 but only quantitative differences, 
 between the psychic 
life of the normal person and that of the neurotic, 
 the analysis 
of those dreams in which, 
 in sound and sick persons alike, 
 the 
repressed complexes display the same activity, 
 reveals the absolute identity of the mechanisms as well as of the symbolism.
 
Indeed, 
 the natural dreams of healthy persons often contain a 
much simpler, 
 more transparent, 
 and more characteristic symbolism than those of neurotics, 
 which, 
 owing to the greater strictness of the censorship and the more extensive dream-distortion 
resulting therefrom, 
 are frequently troubled and obscured, 
 and 
are therefore more difficult to translate.
 The following dream 
serves to illustrate this fact.
 This dream comes from a nonneurotic girl of a rather prudish and reserved type.
 In the course 
of conversation I found that she was engaged to be married, 
 but 
that there were hindrances in the way of the marriage which 
threatened to postpone it.
 She related spontaneously the following dream: 

I arrange the centre of a table with flowers for a birthday .
 On 
being questioned she states that in the dream she seemed to be 
at home (she has no home at the time) and experienced a feeling 
of happiness.
 

The popular symbolism enables me to translate the dream 
for myself.
 It is the expression of her wish to be married: the 
table, 
 with the flowers in the centre, 
 is symbolic of herself and 
her genitals.
 She represents her future wishes as fulfilled, 
 inasmuch as she is already occupied with thoughts of the birth of a 
child;
 so the wedding has taken place long ago.
 

I call her attention to the fact that the centre of a table is 
an unusual expression, 
 which she admits;
 but here, 
 of course, 
 I 
cannot question her more directly.
 I carefully refrain from suggesting to her the meaning of the symbols, 
 and ask her only for 
the thoughts which occur to her mind in connection with the 
individual parts of the dream.
 In the course of the analysis her 
reserve gave way to a distinct interest in the interpretation, 
 and 
a frankness which was made possible by the serious tone of the 
conversation.
 — To my question as to what kind of flowers they 
had been, 
 her first answer is expensive flowers ;
 one has to pay 
for them then she adds that they were lilies-of-the-valley, 
 violets r, 
 and pinks or carnations .
 I took the word lily in this dream in 
its popular sense, 
 as a symbol of chastity;
 she confirmed this, 
 as 
purity occurred to her in association with lily.
 Valley is a common feminine dream-symbol.
 The chance juxtaposition of the 
two symbols in the name of the flower is made into a piece of 
dream-symbolism, 
 and serves to emphasize the preciousness of 
her virginity — expensive flowers ;
 one has to pay for them — and 
expresses the expectation that her husband will know how to 
appreciate its value.
 The comment, 
 expensive flowers, 
 etc.
, 
 has, 
 
as will be shown, 
 a different meaning in every one of the three 
different flower-symbols.
 

I thought of what seemed to me a venturesome explanation of 
the hidden meaning of the apparently quite asexual word violets 
by an unconscious relation to the French viol .
 But to my surprise 
the dreamer's association was the English word violate .
 The 
accidental phonetic similarity of the two words violet and violate is utilized by the dream to express in the language of flowers the idea of the violence of defloration (another word which 
makes use of flower-symbolism), 
 and perhaps also to give expression 
to a masochistic tendency on the part of the girl.
 — An 
excellent example of the word bridges across which run the 
paths to the unconscious.
 One has to pay for them  here means 
life, 
 with which she has to pay for becoming a wife and a mother.
 

In association with pinks, 
 which she then calls carnations, 
 I 
think of carnal.
 But her association is colour, 
 to which she adds 
that carnations are the flowers which her fiance gives her frequently and in large quantities.
 At the end of the conversation 
she suddenly admits, 
 spontaneously, 
 that she has not told me 
the truth;
 the word that occurred to her was not colour, 
 but incarnation, 
 the very word I expected.
 Moreover, 
 even the word 
colour is not a remote association;
 it was determined by the 
meaning of carnation (i.
e.
 flesh-colour ) — that is, 
 by the complex.
 This lack of honesty shows that the resistance here is at its 
greatest because the symbolism is here most transparent, 
 and the 
struggle between libido and repression is most intense in connection with this phallic theme.
 The remark that these flowers were 
often given her by her fiance is, 
 together with the double meaning of carnation, 
 a still further indication of their phallic significance in the dream.
 The occasion of the present of flowers during 
the day is employed to express the thought of a sexual present 
and a return present.
 She gives her virginity and expects in return for it a rich love-life.
 But the words:  expensive flowers ;
 
one has to pay for them may have a real, 
 financial meaning.
 — 
The flower-symbolism in the dream thus comprises the virginal 
female, 
 the male symbol, 
 and the reference to violent defloration.
 
It is to be noted that sexual flower-symbolism, 
 which, 
 of course, 
 
is very widespread, 
 symbolizes the human sexual organs by 
flowers, 
 the sexual organs of plants;
 indeed, 
 presents of flowers 
between lovers may perhaps have this unconscious significance.
 

The birthday for which she is making preparations in the 
dream probably signifies the birth of a child.
 She identifies herself with the bridegroom, 
 and represents him preparing her for 
a birth (having coitus with her).
 It is as though the latent 
thoughts were to say: If I were he, 
 I would not wait, 
 but I 
would deflower the bride without asking her;
 I would use violence.
 Indeed, 
 the word violate points to this.
 Thus even the 
sadistic libidinal components find expression.
 

In a deeper stratum of the dream the sentence 1 arrange , 
 etc.
, 
 
probably has an auto-erotic, 
 that is, 
 an infantile significance.
 

She also has a knowledge — possible only in the dream — of her 
physical need;
 she sees herself fiat like a table, 
 so that she emphasizes all the more her virginity, 
 the costliness of the centre 
(another time she calls it a centre-piece of flowers).
 Even the 
horizontal element of the table may contribute something to the 
symbol.
 — The concentration of the dream is worthy of remark;
 
nothing is superfluous, 
 every word is a symbol.
 

Later on she brings me a supplement to this dream: I decorate the flowers with green crinkled paper She adds that it 
was fancy paper of the sort which is used to disguise ordinary 
flower-pots.
 She says also: To hide untidy things, 
 whatever 
was to be seen which was not pretty to the eye;
 there is a gap, 
 
a little space in the flowers.
 The paper looks like velvet or moss.
 
With decorate she associates decorum , 
 as I expected.
 The green 
colour is very prominent, 
 and with this she associates hope , 
 yet 
another reference to pregnancy.
 — In this part of the dream the 
identification with the man is not the dominant feature, 
 but 
thoughts of shame and frankness express themselves.
 She makes 
herself beautiful for him;
 she admits physical defects, 
 of which 
she is ashamed and which she wishes to correct.
 The associations 
velvet and moss distinctly point to crines pubis.
 

The dream is an expression of thoughts hardly known to the 
waking state of the girl;
 thoughts which deal with the love of 
the senses and its organs;
 she is prepared for a birth-day, 
 i.
e.
 
she has coitus;
 the fear of defloration and perhaps the pleasurably toned pain find expression;
 she admits her physical defects and over-compensates them by means of an over-estimation 
of the value of her virginity.
 Her shame excuses the emerging 
sensuality by the fact that the aim of it all is the child.
 Even 
material considerations, 
 which are foreign to the lover, 
 find expression here.
 The affect of the simple dream — the feeling of 
bliss — shows that here strong emotional complexes have found 
satisfaction.
 

I close with the 

9 .
 Dream of a Chemist 

(A young man who has been trying to give up his habit of 
masturbation by substituting intercourse with a woman.
) 

Preliminary statement: On the day before the dream he had 
been instructing a student as to Grignard’s reaction, 
 in which 
magnesium is dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic influence of iodine.
 Two days earlier there had been an 
explosion in the course of the same reaction, 
 in which someone 
had burned his hand.
 

Dream I .
He is going to make phenylmagnesiumbromide ;
 he 
sees the apparatus with particular distinctness, 
 but he has substituted himself for the magnesium.
 He is now in a curious, 
 wavering attitude .
 He keeps on repeating to himself: This is the 
right thing , 
 it is working, 
 my feet are beginning to dissolve , 
 and 
my knees are getting soft.
 97 Then he reaches down and feels for 
his feet, 
 and meanwhile {he does not know how) he takes his legs 
out of the carboy , 
 and then again he says to himself: That can*t 
be.
.
.
 Yes, 
 it has been done correctly 79 Then he partially wakes, 
 
and repeats the dream to himself, 
 because he wants to tell it to 
me.
 He is positively afraid of the analysis of the dream .
 He is 
much excited during this state of semi-sleep , 
 and repeats continually: Phenyl, 
 phenyl 97 

II.
 He is in .
 .
 .
 with his whole family .
 He is supposed to be at 
the Schottentor at half-past eleven in order to keep an appointment with the lady in question, 
 but he does not wake until halfpast eleven .
 He says to himself: It is too late now;
 when you 
get there it will be half-past twelve 77 The next moment he sees 
the whole family gathered about the table — his mother and the 
parlourmaid with the soup-tureen with peculiar distinctness.
 
Then he says to himself: Well, 
 if we are sitting down to eat 
already, 
 1 certainly can 7 t get away.
 77 

Analysis .
 — He feels sure that even the first dream contains a 
reference to the lady whom he is to meet at the place of rendezvous (the dream was dreamed during the night before the 
expected meeting).
 The student whom he was instructing is a 
particularly unpleasant fellow;
 the chemist had said to him: 
That isn’t right, 
 because the magnesium was still unaffected, 
 
and the student had answered, 
 as though he were quite unconcemed: 
Nor it is.
 He himself must be this student;
 he is as 
indifferent to his analysis as the student is to his synthesis;
 the he 
in the dream, 
 however, 
 who performs the operation, 
 is myself.
 
How unpleasant he must seem to me with his indifference to the 
result! 

Again, 
 he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) 
is made.
 For the question is the success of the treatment.
 The 
legs in the dream recall an impression of the previous evening.
 He 
met a lady at a dancing class of whom he wished to make a 
conquest;
 he pressed her to him so closely that she once cried 
out.
 As he ceased to press her legs he felt her firm, 
 responding 
pressure against his lower thighs as far as just above the knees, 
 
the spot mentioned in the dream.
 In this situation, 
 then, 
 the 
woman is the magnesium in the retort, 
 which is at last working.
 
He is feminine towards me, 
 as he is virile towards the woman.
 
If he succeeds with the woman, 
 the treatment will also succeed.
 
Feeling himself and becoming aware of his knees refers to 
masturbation, 
 and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous 
day .
 .
 .
 The rendezvous had actually been made for half-past 
eleven.
 His wish to oversleep himself and to keep to his sexual 
object at home (that is, 
 masturbation) corresponds to his resistance.
 

He says, 
 in respect to the repetition of the name phenyl, 
 that 
all these radicals ending in yl have always been pleasing to him;
 
they are very convenient to use: benzyl, 
 acetyl, 
 etc.
 That, 
 however, 
 explained nothing.
 But when I proposed the root 
SchlemihP 9 he laughed heartily, 
 and told me that during the 
summer he had read a book by Prevost which contained a chapter : Les exclus de V amour, 
 and in this there was some mention of 
Schlemilies;
 and in reading of these outcasts he said to himself: 
That is my case.
 He would have played the Schlemihl if he 
had missed the appointment.
 

It seems that the sexual symbolism of dreams has already been 
directly confirmed by experiment.
 In 1912 Dr.
 K.
 Schrotter, 
 at 
the instance of H.
 Swoboda, 
 produced dreams in deeply hypnotized persons by suggestions which determined a large part of 
the dream-content.
 If the suggestion proposed that the subject 
should dream of normal or abnormal sexual relations, 
 the dream 
carried out these orders by replacing sexual material by the symbols with which psychoanalytic dream-interpretation has made 
us familiar .
 Thus, 
 following the suggestion that the dreamer 
should dream of homosexual relations with a lady friend, 
 this 
friend appeared in the dream carrying a shabby travelling-bag, 
 
upon which there was a label with the printed words: For ladies 
only.
 The dreamer was believed never to have heard of dreamsymbolization or of dream-interpretation.
 Unfortunately, 
 the 
value of this important investigation was diminished by the fact 
that Dr.
 Schrotter shortly afterwards committed suicide.
 Of 
his dream-experiments he gave us only a preliminary report in 
the Zentralblatt jiir Psychoanalyse.
 

Similar results were reported in 1923 by G.
 Roffenstein.
 Especially interesting were the experiments performed by Betlheim 
and Hartmann , 
 because they eliminated hypnosis.
 These authors 
told stories of a crude sexual content to confused patients suffering from Korsakoff’s psychosis, 
 and observed the distortions 
which appeared when the material related was reproduced.
 60 It 
was shown that the reproduced material contained symbols made 
familiar by the interpretation of dreams (climbing stairs, 
 stabbing and shooting as symbols of coitus, 
 knives and cigarettes as 
symbols of the penis) .
 Special value was attached to the appearance of the symbol of climbing stairs, 
 for, 
 as the authors justly 
observed, 
 a symbolization of this sort could not be effected by a 
conscious wish to distort.
 

Only when we have formed a due estimate of the importance 
of symbolism in dreams can we continue the study of the typical 
dreams which was interrupted in an earlier chapter (p.
 165).
 I 
feel justified in dividing these dreams roughly into two classes: 
first, 
 those which always really have the same meaning, 
 and 
se cor t f1 j those which despite the same or a similar content must 
nevertheless be given the most varied interpretations.
 Of the 
typical dr eams belonging to the first class I have already dealt 
fairly fully with the examination-dream.
 

60 Cfjer Fehlreaktionen be i der Korsokoffschen Psychose,

chiatrie, 
 Bd.
 taii, 
 1924.
 

On account of their similar affective character, 
 the dreams of 
missing a train deserve to be ranked with the examinationdreams;
 moreover, 
 their interpretation justifies this approximation.
 They are consolation-dreams, 
 directed against another 
anxiety perceived in dreams — the fear of death.
 To depart is 
one of the most frequent and one of the most readily established 
of the death-symbols.
 The dream therefore says consolingly: 
Reassure yourself, 
 you are not going to die (to depart), 
 just 
as the examination-dream calms us by saying: Don’t be afraid;
 
this time, 
 too, 
 nothing will happen to you.
 The difficulty in 
understanding both kinds of dreams is due to the fact that the 
anxiety is attached precisely to the expression of consolation.
 

The meaning of the dreams due to dental stimulus which I 
have often enough had to analyse in my patients escaped me for 
a long time because, 
 much to my astonishment, 
 they habitually 
offered too great a resistance to interpretation.
 But finally an 
overwhelming mass of evidence convinced me that in the case of 
men nothing other than the masturbatory desires of puberty 
furnish the motive power of these dreams.
 I shall analyse two 
such dreams, 
 one of which is also a flying dream.
 The two 
dreams were dreamed by the same person — a young man of pronounced homosexuality which, 
 however, 
 has been inhibited in 
life.
 

He is witnessing a performance of Fidelio from the stalls of 
the opera-house;
 he is sitting next to L.
, 
 whose personality is 
congenial to Mm, 
 and whose friendship he would like to have .
 
Suddenly he flies diagonally right across the stalls;
 he then puts 
his hand in his mouth and draws out two of his teeth .
 

He himself describes the flight by saying that it was as though 
he were thrown into the air.
 As the opera performed was Fidelio , 
 
he recalls the words: — 

He who a charming wife acquires.
 .
 .
  

But the acquisition of even the most charming wife is not among 
the wishes of the dreamer.
 Two other lines would be more appropriate: — 

He who succeeds in the lucky (big) throw 

The friend of a friend to be  

The dream thus contains the lucky (big) throw, 
 which is not, 
 
however, 
 a wish-fulfilment only.
 For it conceals also the painful 
reflection that in his striving after friendship he has often had 
the misfortune to be thrown out, 
 and the fear lest this fate may 
be repeated in the case of the young man by whose side he has 
enjoyed the performance of Fidelio .
 This is now followed by a 
confession, 
 shameful to a man of his refinement, 
 to the effect 
that once, 
 after such a rejection on the part of a friend, 
 his 
profound sexual longing caused him to masturbate twice in 
succession.
 

The other dream is as follows: Two university professors of 
his acquaintance are treating him in my place.
 One of them does 
something to his penis;
 he is afraid of an operation.
 The other 
thrusts an iron bar against his mouth , 
 so that he loses one or two 
teeth.
 He is bound with four silk handkerchiefs.
 

The sexual significance of this dream can hardly be doubted.
 
The silk handkerchiefs allude to an identification with a homosexual of his acquaintance.
 The dreamer, 
 who has never achieved 
coition (nor has he ever actually sought sexual intercourse) with 
men, 
 conceives the sexual act on the lines of masturbation with 
which he was familiar during puberty.
 

I believe that the frequent modifications of the typical dream 
due to dental stimulus — that, 
 for example, 
 in which another person draws the tooth from the dreamer’s mouth — will be made 
intelligible by the same explanation .
 61 It may, 
 however, 
 be difficult to understand how dental stimulus can have come to have 
this significance.
 But here I may draw attention to the frequent 
displacement from below to above which is at the service of 
sexual repression, 
 and by means of which all kinds of sensations 
and intentions occurring in hysteria, 
 which ought to be localized 
in the genitals, 
 may at all events be realized in other, 
 unobjectionable parts of the body.
 We have a case of such displacement 
when the genitals are replaced by the face in the symbolism of 
unconscious thought.
 This is corroborated by the fact that 
61 The extraction of a tooth by another is usually to be interpreted as castration (cf.
 hair-cutting;
 Stekel).
 One must distinguish between dreams 
due to dental stimulus and dreams referring to the dentist, 
 such as have 
been recorded, 
 for example, 
 by Coriat (Zentralblatt fur Psychoanalyse , 
 iii, 
 
440 ).
 

verbal usage relates the buttocks to the cheeks , 
 62 and the labia 
minora to the lips which enclose the orifice of the mouth.
 The 
nose is compared to the penis in numerous allusions, 
 and in each 
case the presence of hair completes the resemblance.
 Only one 
feature — the teeth — is beyond all possibility of being compared 
in this way;
 but it is just this coincidence of agreement and disagreement which makes the teeth suitable for purposes of representation under the pressure of sexual repression.
 

I will not assert that the interpretation of dreams due to 
dental stimulus as dreams of masturbation (the correctness of 
which I cannot doubt) has been freed of all obscurity .
 63 I 
carry the explanation as far as I am able, 
 and must leave the rest 
unsolved.
 But I must refer to yet another relation indicated by 
a colloquial expression.
 In Austria there is in use an indelicate 
designation for the act of masturbation, 
 namely: To pull one 
out, 
 or to pull one off .
 64 I am unable to say whence these 
colloquialisms originate, 
 or on what symbolisms they are 
based;
 but the teeth would very well fit in with the first of the 
two.
 

Dreams of pulling teeth, 
 and of teeth falling out, 
 are interpreted in popular belief to mean the death of a connection.
 
Psychoanalysis can admit of such a meaning only at the most as 
a joking allusion to the sense already indicated.
 

To the second group of typical dreams belong those in which 
one is flying or hovering, 
 falling, 
 swimming, 
 etc.
 What do these 
dreams signify? Here we cannot generalize.
 They mean, 
 as we 
shall learn, 
 something different in each case;
 only, 
 the sensory 
material which they contain always comes from the same source.
 

We must conclude from the information obtained in psychoanalysis that these dreams also repeat impressions of our childhood 
— that is, 
 that they refer to the games involving movement 
which have such an extraordinary attraction for children.
 Where 
is the uncle who has never made a child fly by running with it 
across the room, 
 with outstretched arms, 
 or has never played at 
falling with it by rocking it on his knee and then suddenly 
straightening his leg, 
 or by lifting it above his head and suddenly pretending to withdraw his supporting hand? At such 
moments children shout with joy and insatiably demand a repetition of the performance, 
 especially if a little fright and dizziness are involved in it.
 In after years they repeat their sensations 
in dreams, 
 but in dreams they omit the hands that held them, 
 so 
that now they are free to float or fall.
 We know that all small 
children have a fondness for such games as rocking and seesawing;
 and when they see gymnastic performances at the circus 
their recollection of such games is refreshed.
 In some boys the 
hysterical attack consists simply in the reproduction of such 
performances, 
 which they accomplish with great dexterity.
 Not 
infrequently sexual sensations are excited by these games of 
movement, 
 innocent though they are in themselves.
 To express 
the matter in a few words: it is these romping games of childhood which are being repeated in dreams of flying, 
 falling, 
 vertigo, 
 and the like, 
 but the pleasurable sensations are now transformed into anxiety.
 But, 
 as every mother knows, 
 the romping 
of children often enough ends in quarrelling and tears.
 

I have therefore good reason for rejecting the explanation that 
it is the condition of our cutaneous sensations during sleep, 
 the 
sensation of the movements of the lungs, 
 etc.
, 
 that evoke dreams 
of flying and falling.
 As I see it, 
 these sensations have themselves 
been reproduced from the memory to which the dream refers — that they are therefore dream-content, 
 and not dreamsouces .
 65 

This material, 
 consisting of sensations of motion, 
 similar in 
character, 
 and originating from the same sources, 
 is now used 
for the representation of the most manifold dream-thoughts.
 
Dreams of flying or hovering, 
 for the most part pleasurably 
toned, 
 will call for the most widely differing interpretations — 
interpretations of a quite special nature in the case of some 
dreamers, 
 and interpretations of a typical nature in that of 
others.
 One of my patients was in the habit of dreaming very 
frequently that she was hovering a little way above the street 
without touching the ground.
 She was very short of stature, 
 and 
she shunned every sort of contamination involved by intercourse 
with human beings.
 Her dream of suspension — which raised her 
feet above the ground and allowed her head to tower into the 
air — fulfilled both of her wishes.
 In the case of other dreamers 
of the same sex, 
 the dream of flying had the significance of the 
longing: If only I were a little bird! Similarly, 
 others become 
angels at night, 
 because no one has ever called them angels by 
day.
 The intimate connection between flying and the idea of a 
bird makes it comprehensible that the dream of flying, 
 in the 
case of male dreamers, 
 should usually have a coarsely sensual 
significance 66 ;
 and we should not be surprised to hear that this 
or that dreamer is always very proud of his ability to fly.
 

Dr.
 Paul Federn (Vienna) has propounded the fascinating 
theory that a great many flying dreams are erection dreams, 
 
since the remarkable phenomenon of erection, 
 which constantly 
occupies the human phantasy, 
 cannot fail to be impressive as an 
apparent suspension of the laws of gravity (cf.
 the winged phalli 
of the ancients) .
 

It is a noteworthy fact that a prudent experimenter like 
Mourly Void, 
 who is really averse to any kind of interpretation, 
 
nevertheless defends the erotic interpretation of the dreams of 
flying and hovering .
 67 He describes the erotic element as the 
most important motive factor of the hovering dream, 
 and refers to the strong sense of bodily vibration which accompanies 
this type of dream, 
 and the frequent connection of such dreams 
with erections and emissions.
 

Dreams of falling are more frequently characterized by anxiety.
 Their interpretation, 
 when they occur in women, 
 offers no 
difficulty, 
 because they nearly always accept the symbolic meaning of falling, 
 which is a circumlocution for giving way to an 
erotic temptation.
 We have not yet exhausted the infantile 
sources of the dream of falling;
 nearly all children have fallen 
occasionally, 
 and then been picked up and fondled;
 if they fell 
out of bed at night, 
 they were picked up by the nurse and taken 
into her bed.
 

People who dream often, 
 and with great enjoyment, 
 of swimming, 
 cleaving the waves, 
 etc.
, 
 have usually been bed-wetters, 
 
and they now repeat in the dream a pleasure which they have 
long since learned to forgo.
 We shall soon learn, 
 from one example or another, 
 to what representations dreams of swimming 
easily lend themselves.
 

The interpretation of dreams of fire justifies a prohibition of 
the nursery, 
 which forbids children to play with fire so that 
they may not wet the bed at night.
 These dreams also are based 
on reminiscences of the enuresis nocturna of childhood.
 In my 
Fragment of an Analysis of Hysteria 68 1 have given the complete 
analysis and synthesis of such a dream of fire in connection with 
the infantile history of the dreamer, 
 and have shown for the 
representation of what maturer impulses this infantile material 
has been utilized.
 

It would be possible to cite quite a number of other typical 
dreams, 
 if by such one understands dreams in which there is a 
frequent recurrence, 
 in the dreams of different persons, 
 of the 
same manifest dream-content.
 For example: dreams of passing 
through narrow alleys, 
 or a whole suite of rooms;
 dreams of 
burglars, 
 in respect of whom nervous people take measures of 
precaution before going to bed;
 dreams of being chased by wild 
animals (bulls, 
 horses);
 or of being threatened with knives, 
 
daggers, 
 and lances.
 The last two themes are characteristic of 
the manifest dream-content of persons suffering from anxiety, 
 
etc.
 A special investigation of this class of material would be 
well worth while.
 In lieu of this I shall offer two observations, 
 
which do not, 
 however, 
 apply exclusively to typical dreams.
 

The more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, 
 the 
readier one becomes to acknowledge that the majority of the 
dreams of adults deal with sexual material and give expression 
to erotic wishes.
 Only those who really analyse dreams, 
 that is, 
 
those who penetrate from their manifest content to the latent 
dream-thoughts, 
 can form an opinion on this subject;
 but never 
those who are satisfied with registering merely the manifest content (as, 
 for example, 
 Nacke in his writings on sexual dreams).
 
Let us recognize at once that there is nothing astonishing in this 
fact, 
 which is entirely consistent with the principles of dreaminterpretation.
 No other instinct has had to undergo so much 
suppression, 
 from the time of childhood onwards, 
 as the sexual 
instinct in all its numerous components: 69 — from no other instinct are so many and such intense unconscious wishes left over, 
 
which now, 
 in the sleeping state, 
 generate dreams.
 In dreaminterpretation this importance of the sexual complexes must 
never be forgotten, 
 though one must not, 
 of course, 
 exaggerate 
it to the exclusion of all other factors.
 

Of many dreams it may be ascertained, 
 by careful interpretation, 
 that they may even be understood bisexually, 
 inasmuch as 
they yield an indisputable over-interpretation, 
 in which they 
realize homosexual impulses — that is, 
 impulses which are contrary to the normal sexual activity of the dreamer.
 But that all 
dreams are to be interpreted bisexually, 
 as Stekel 70 maintains, 
 
and Adler , 
 71 seems to me to be a generalization as insusceptible 
of proof as it is improbable, 
 and one which, 
 therefore, 
 I should 
be loth to defend;
 for I should, 
 above all, 
 be at a loss to know 
how to dispose of the obvious fact that there are many dreams 
which satisfy other than erotic needs (taking the word in the 
widest sense), 
 as, 
 for example, 
 dreams of hunger, 
 thirst, 
 comfort, 
 etc.
 And other similar assertions, 
 to the effect that behind 
every dream one finds a reference to death (Stekel), 
 or that 
every dream shows an advance from the feminine to the masculine line (Adler), 
 seem to me to go far beyond the admissible in the interpretation of dreams.
 The assertion that all dreams 
call for a sexual interpretation, 
 against which there is such an 
untiring polemic in the literature of the subject, 
 is quite foreign 
to my Interpretation of Dreams .
 It will not be found in any of 
the eight editions of this book, 
 and is in palpable contradiction 
to the rest of its contents.
 

We have stated elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously innocent commonly embody crude erotic wishes, 
 and this 
we might confirm by numerous further examples.
 But many 
dreams which appear indifferent, 
 in which we should never 
suspect a tendency in any particular direction, 
 may be traced, 
 
according to the analysis, 
 to unmistakably sexual wish-impulses, 
 
often of an unsuspected nature.
 For example, 
 who, 
 before it had 
been interpreted, 
 would have suspected a sexual wish in the 
following dream? The dreamer relates: Between two stately 
palaces there stands , 
 a little way back, 
 a small house, 
 whose 
doors are closed , 
 My wife leads me along the little bit of road 
leading to the house and pushes the door open , 
 and then I slip 
quickly and easily into the interior of a courtyard that slopes 
steeply upwards .
 

Anyone who has had experience in the translating of dreams 
will, 
 of course, 
 at once be reminded that penetration into narrow spaces and the opening of locked doors are among the commonest of sexual symbols, 
 and will readily see in this dream a 
representation of attempted coition from behind (between the 
two stately buttocks of the female body).
 The narrow, 
 steep 
passage is, 
 of course, 
 the vagina;
 the assistance attributed to 
the wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality 
it is only consideration for the wife which is responsible for 
abstention from such an attempt.
 Moreover, 
 inquiry shows that 
on the previous day a young girl had entered the household of 
the dreamer;
 she had pleased him, 
 and had given him the impression that she would not be altogether averse to an approach 
of this sort.
 The little house between the two palaces is taken 
from the reminiscence of the Hradschin in Prague, 
 and once 
more points to the girl, 
 who is a native of that city.
 

If, 
 in conversation with my patients, 
 I emphasize the frequency of the Oedipus dream — the dream of having sexual intercourse with one’s mother — I elicit the answer: I cannot remember such a dream.
 Immediately afterwards, 
 however, 
 there 
arises the recollection of another, 
 an unrecognizable, 
 indifferent 
dream, 
 which the patient has dreamed repeatedly, 
 and which on 
analysis proves to be a dream with this very content — that is, 
 
yet another Oedipus dream.
 I can assure the reader that disguised 
dreams of sexual intercourse with the dreamer's mother are far 
more frequent than undisguised dreams to the same effect .
 72 
72 X have published a typical example of such a disguised Oedipus dream in 
No.
 1 of the Zentralblatt fur Psychoanalyse (see below) ;
 another, 
 with a 
detailed analysis, 
 was published in No.
 4 of the same journal by Otto Rank.
 
For other disguised Oedipus dreams in which the eye appears as a symbol, 
 
see Rank ( Int .
 Zeitschr .
 fur PsA .
, 
 i, 
 1913)* Papers upon eye dreams and 
eye symbolism by Eder, 
 Ferenczi, 
 and Reitler will be found in the same 
issue.
 The blinding in the Oedipus legend and elsewhere is a substitute for 
castration.
 The ancients, 
 by the way, 
 were not unfamiliar with the symbolic interpretation of the undisguised Oedipus dream (see 0 .
 Rank, 
 Jahrb.
 
ii, 
 P- S 3 4: Thus, 
 a dream of Julius Caesar’s of sexual relations with his 
mother has been handed down to us, 
 which the oneiroscopists interpreted 
as a favourable omen signifying his taking possession of the earth (Mother 
Earth) .
 Equally well known is the oracle delivered to the Tarquinii, 
 to the 
elect that that one of them would become the ruler of Rome who should 
be the first to kiss his mother (osculum main tulerit ), 
 which Brutus conceived as referring to Mother Earth (terrain osculo contigit, 
 scilicet quod ea 
communis mater omnium mortalium essetj Livy, 
 I, 
 Ixi) .
 Cf.
 here the dream 
of Hippias in Herodotus, 
 VI, 
 107: But Hippias led the barbarians to 
Marathon after he had had the following dream- vision the previous night.
 
It had seemed to Hippias that he was sleeping with his own mother.
 He 
concluded from this dream that he would return home to Athens, 
 and 
would regain power, 
 and that he would die in his fatherland in his old age.
 
These myths and interpretations point to a correct psychological insight.
 
I have found that those persons who consider themselves preferred or 
favoured by their mothers manifest in life that confidence in themselves, 
 
and that unshakable optimism, 
 which often seem heroic, 
 and not infrequently compel actual success.
 

Typical example of a disguised Oedipus dream: — 

A man dreams: He has a secret affair with a woman whom another man 
wishes to marry.
 He is concerned lest the other should discover this relation 
and abandon the marriage;
 he therefore behaves very affectionately to the 
man;
 he nestles up to him and kisses him.
 — The facts of the dreamer’s life 
touch the dream-content only at one point.
 He has a secret affair with a 
married woman, 
 and an equivocal expression of her husband, 
 with whom 
he is on friendly terms, 
 aroused in him the suspicion that he might have 
noticed something of this relationship.
 There is, 
 however, 
 in reality, 
 yet 
another factor, 
 the mention of which was avoided in the dream, 
 and which 
alone gives the key to it.
 The life of the husband is threatened by an organic 
malady.
 His wife is prepared for the possibility of his sudden death, 
 and 

There are dreams of landscapes and localities in which emphasis is always laid upon the assurance: I have been here 
before.
 But this " Deja vu has a special significance in dreams.
 
In this case the locality is always the genitals of the mother;
 of 
no other place can it be asserted with such certainty that one 
has been here before.
 I was once puzzled by the account of a 
dream given by a patient afflicted with obsessional neurosis.
 He 
dreamed that he called at a house where he had been twice before.
 But this very patient had long ago told me of an episode 
of his sixth year.
 At that time he shared his mother’s bed, 
 and 
had abused the occasion by inserting his finger into his mother’s 
genitals while she was asleep.
 

A large number of dreams, 
 which are frequently full of 
anxiety, 
 and often have for content the traversing of narrow 
spaces, 
 or staying long in the water, 
 are based upon phantasies 
concerning the intra-uterine life, 
 the sojourn in the mother’s 
womb, 
 and the act of birth.
 I here insert the dream of a young 
man who, 
 in his phantasy, 
 has even profited by the intra-uterine 
opportunity of spying upon an act of coition between his parents.
 

He is in a deep shaft, 
 in which there is a window, 
 as in the 
Semmering tunnel .
 Through this he sees at first an empty landscape, 
 and then he composes a picture in it, 
 which is there all at 
once and fills up the empty space .
 The picture represents a field 
which is being deeply tilled by an implement, 
 and the wholesome 
air, 
 the associated idea of hard work, 
 and the bluish-black clods 
of earth make a pleasant impression on him .
 He then goes on and 
sees a work on education lying open .
 .
 .
 and is surprised that so 
much attention is devoted in it to the sexual feelings (of children), 
 which makes him think of me, 
  

our dreamer consciously harbours the intention of marrying the young 
widow after her husband’s decease.
 It is through this objective situation 
that the dreamer finds himself transferred into the constellation of the 
Oedipus dream;
 his wish is to be enabled to lull the man, 
 so that he may 
win the woman for his wife ;
 his dream gives expression to the wish in a 
hypocritical distortion.
 Instead of representing her as already married to 
the other man, 
 it represents the other man only as wishing to marry her, 
 
which indeed corresponds with his own secret intention, 
 and the hostile 
wishes directed against the man are concealed under demonstrations ol 
affection, 
 which are reminiscences of his childish relations to his father.
 

Here is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, 
 which was 
turned to special account in the course of treatment.
 

At her usual holiday resort on the .
 .
 .
 Lake , 
 she flings herself 
into the dark water at a place where the pale moon is reflected 
in the water .
 

Dreams of this sort are parturition dreams;
 their interpretation is effected by reversing the fact recorded in the manifest 
dream-content;
 thus, 
 instead of flinging oneself into the water, 
 
read coming out of the water — that is, 
 being bom  73 The 
place from which one is born may be recognized if one thinks of 
the humorous sense of the French la lune The pale moon thus 
becomes the white bottom, 
 which the child soon guesses to be 
the place from which it came.
 Now what can be the meaning of 
the patient's wishing to be bom at a holiday resort? I asked the 
dreamer this, 
 and she replied without hesitation: Hasn't the 
treatment made me as though I were born again? Thus the 
dream becomes an invitation to continue the treatment at this 
summer resort— that is, 
 to visit her there;
 perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion to the wish to become a mother 
herself 7 * 

Another dream of parturition, 
 with its interpretation, 
 I take 
from a paper by E.
 Jones.
 She stood at the seashore watching a 
small boy , 
 who seemed to be hers, 
 wading into the water .
 This he 
did till the water covered him and she could only see his head 
bobbing up and down near the surface .
 The scene then changed 
to the crowded hall of an hotel .
 Her husband left her, 
 and she 
* entered into conversation with ' a stranger .
 

The second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis 
to represent flight from her husband, 
 and the entering into intimate relations with a third person, 
 behind whom was plainly 
indicated Mr.
 X.
 5 s brother, 
 mentioned in a former dream.
 The first 
part of the dream was a fairly evident birth-phantasy.
 In dreams 
as in mythology, 
 the delivery of a child from the uterine waters 
is commonly represented, 
 by way of distortion, 
 as the entry of 
the child into water;
 among many other instances, 
 the births of 
Adonis, 
 Osiris, 
 Moses, 
 and Bacchus are well-known illustrations 
of this.
 The bobbing up and down of the head in the water at once 
recalled to the patient the sensation of quickening which she 
had experienced in her only pregnancy.
 Thinking of the boy 
going into the water induced a reverie in which she saw herself 
taking him out of the water, 
 carrying him into the nursery, 
 washing and dressing him, 
 and installing him in her household.
 

The second half of the dream, 
 therefore, 
 represents thoughts 
concerning the elopement, 
 which belonged to the first half of the 
underlying latent content;
 the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half of the latent content, 
 the birth 
phantasy.
 Besides this inversion in the order, 
 further inversions 
took place in each half of the dream.
 In the first half the child 
entered the water, 
 and then his head bobbed;
 in the underlying 
dream-thoughts the quickening occurred first, 
 and then the child 
left the water (a double inversion).
 In the second half 
her husband left her;
 in the dream-thoughts she left her husband.
 

Another parturition dream is related by Abraham — the dream 
of a young woman expecting her first confinement: From one 
point of the floor of the room a subterranean channel leads directly into the water ( path of parturition — amniotic fluid).
 She 
lifts up a trap in the floor , 
 and there immediately appears a creature dressed in brownish fur , 
 which almost resembles a seal .
 This 
creature changes into the dreamer’s younger brother , 
 to whom 
her relation has always been maternal in character .
 

Rank has shown from a number of dreams that parturitiondreams employ the same symbols as micturition-dreams.
 The 
erotic stimulus expresses itself in these dreams as an urethral 
stimulus.
 The stratification of meaning in these dreams corresponds 
with a change in the significance of the symbol since 
childhood.
 

We may here turn back to the interrupted theme (see p.
 36) 
of the part played by organic, 
 sleep-disturbing stimuli in dreamformation.
 Dreams which have come into existence under these 
influences not only reveal quite frankly the wish-fulfilling tendency, 
 and the character of convenience-dreams, 
 but they very 
often display a quite transparent symbolism as well, 
 since waking not infrequently follows a stimulus whose satisfaction in 
symbolic disguise has already been vainly attempted in the 
dream.
 This is true of emission dreams as well as those evoked 
by the need to urinate or defecate.
 The peculiar character of 
emission dreams permits us directly to unmask certain sexual 
symbols already recognized as typical, 
 but nevertheless violently 
disputed, 
 and it also convinces us that many an apparently innocent dream-situation is merely the symbolic prelude to a 
crudely sexual scene.
 This, 
 however, 
 finds direct representation, 
 
as a rule, 
 only in the comparatively infrequent emission dreams, 
 
while it often enough turns into an anxiety-dream, 
 which likewise leads to waking.
 

The symbolism of dreams due to urethral stimulus is especially obvious, 
 and has always been divined.
 Hippocrates had 
already advanced the theory that a disturbance of the bladder 
was indicated if one dreamt of fountains and springs (Havelock 
Ellis).
 Schemer, 
 who has studied the manifold symbolism of 
the urethral stimulus, 
 agrees that the powerful urethral stimulus always turns into the stimulation of the sexual sphere and 
its symbolic imagery.
 .
 .
 .
 The dream due to urethral stimulus is 
often at the same time the representative of the sexual dream.
 

0 .
 Rank, 
 whose conclusions (in his paper on Die Symbolsckichtung im Wecktraum) I have here followed, 
 argues very 
plausibly that a large number of dreams due to urethral stimulus are really caused by sexual stimuli, 
 which at first seek to 
gratify themselves by way of regression to the infantile form of 
urethral erotism.
 Those cases are especially instructive in which 
the urethral stimulus thus produced leads to waking and the 
emptying of the bladder, 
 whereupon, 
 in spite of this relief, 
 the 
dream is continued, 
 and expresses its need in undisguisedly 
erotic images .
 75 

In a quite analogous manner dreams due to intestinal stimulus disclose the pertinent symbolism, 
 and thus confirm the relation, 
 which is also amply verified by ethno-psychology, 
 of gold 
and feces 76 Thus, 
 for example, 
 a woman, 
 at a time when she is 
under the care of a physician on account of an intestinal disorder, 
 dreams of a digger for hidden treasure who is burying a 
treasure in the vicinity of a little wooden shed which looks like 
a rural privy, 
 A second part of the dream has as its content how 
she wipes the posterior of her child, 
 a little girl, 
 who has soiled 
herself 

Dreams of rescue 57 are connected with parturition dreams.
 
To rescue, 
 especially to rescue from the water, 
 is, 
 when dreamed 
by a woman, 
 equivalent to giving birth;
 this sense is, 
 however, 
 
modified when the dreamer is a man 77 

Robbers, 
 burglars, 
 and ghosts, 
 of which we are afraid before 
going to bed, 
 and which sometimes even disturb our sleep, 
 originate in one and the same childish reminiscence.
 They are the 
nightly visitors who have waked the child in order to set it on 
the chamber, 
 so that it may not wet the bed, 
 or have lifted the 
coverlet in order to see clearly how the child is holding its hands 
while sleeping.
 I have been able to induce an exact recollection 
of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of these anxietydreams.
 The robbers were always the father;
 the ghosts more 
probably corresponded to female persons in white night-gowns.
 

F.
 EXAMPLES— ARITHMETIC AND SPEECH IN DREAMS 

Before I proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the 
factors which control the formation of dreams, 
 I shall cite a few 
examples from my collection of dreams, 
 partly for the purpose 
of illustrating the cooperation of the three factors with which 
we are already acquainted, 
 and partly for the purpose of adducing evidence for certain unsupported assertions which have been 
made, 
 or of bringing out what necessarily follows from them.
 
It has, 
 of course, 
 been difficult in the foregoing account of the 
dream-work to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples.
 Examples in support of isolated statements are convincing only when considered in the context of an interpretation 
of a dream as a whole;
 when they are wrested from their context, 
 they lose their value;
 on the other hand, 
 a dream-interpretation, 
 even when it is by no means profound, 
 soon becomes so 
extensive that it obscures the thread of the discussion which it 
is intended to illustrate.
 This technical consideration must be 
my excuse if I now proceed to mix together all sorts of things 
which have nothing in common except their reference to the 
text of the foregoing chapter.
 

We shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or 
unusual methods of representation in dreams.
 A lady dreamed 
as follows: A servant-girl is standing on a ladder as though to 
clean the windows , 
 and has with her a chimpanzee and a gorilla 
cat (later corrected, 
 angora cat).
 She throws the animals on to 
the dreamer;
 the chimpanzee nestles up to her , 
 and this is very 
disgusting .
 This dream has accomplished its purpose by a very 
simple means, 
 namely, 
 by taking a mere figure of speech literally, 
 and representing it in accordance with the literal meaning 
of its words.
 Monkey, 
 like the names of animals in general, 
 is 
an opprobrious epithet, 
 and the situation of the dream means 
merely to hurl invectives This same collection will soon furnish us with further examples of the employment of this simple 
artifice in the dream-work.
 

Another dream proceeds in a very similar manner: A woman 
with a child which has a conspicuously deformed cranium;
 the 
dreamer has heard that the child acquired this deformity owing 
to its position in its mother’s womb .
 The doctor says that the 
cranium might be given a better shape by means of compression, 
 
but that this would injure the brain .
 She thinks that because it 
is a boy it won’t suffer so much from deformity .
 This dream 
contains a plastic representation of the abstract concept: Childish impressions, 
 with which the dreamer has become familiar 
in the course of the treatment.
 

In the following example the dream-work follows rather a different course.
 The dream contains a recollection of an excursion 
to the Hilmteich, 
 near Graz: There is a terrible storm outside ;
 
a miserable hotel — the water is drippmg from the walls, 
 and the 
beds are damp .
 (The latter part of the content was less directly 
expressed than I give it.
) The dream signifies  superfluous  
The abstract idea occurring in the dream-thoughts is first made 
equivocal by a certain abuse of language;
 it has perhaps been 
replaced by overflowing, 
 or by fluid and super-fluid 
(-fluous), 
 and has then been brought to representation by an 
accumulation of like impressions.
 Water within, 
 water without, 
 
water in the beds in the form of dampness — everything fluid and 
'super fluid.
 That for the purposes of dream-representation the 
spelling is much less considered than the sound of words ought 
not to surprise us when we remember that rhyme exercises a 
similar privilege.
 

The fact that language has at its disposal a great number of 
words which were originally used in a pictorial and concrete 
sense, 
 but are at present used in a colourless and abstract fashion, 
 
has, 
 in certain other cases, 
 made it very easy for the dream to 
represent its thoughts.
 The dream has only to restore to these 
words their full significance, 
 or to follow their change of mean* 
ing a little way back.
 For example, 
 a man dreams that his friend, 
 
who is struggling to get out of a very tight place, 
 calls upon him 
for help.
 The analysis shows that the tight place is a hole, 
 and 
that the dreamer symbolically uses these very words to his 
friend: Be careful, 
 or you’ll get yourself into a hole .
 78 Another dreamer climbs a mountain from which he obtains an 
extraordinarily extensive view.
 He identifies himself with his 
brother, 
 who is editing a review dealing with the Far East.
 

In a dream in Der Grune Heinrich a spirited horse is plunging 
about in a field of the finest oats, 
 every grain of which is really 
a sweet almond, 
 a raisin and a new penny wrapped in red silk 
and tied with a bit of pig’s bristle.
 The poet (or the dreamer) 
immediately furnishes the meaning of this dream, 
 for the horse 
felt himself pleasantly tickled, 
 so that he exclaimed: The oats 
are pricking me (I feel my oats).
