Regarded in isolation, 
an idea may be quite insignificant, 
and venturesome in the extreme, 
but it may acquire importance from an idea which follows it;
perhaps, 
in a certain collocation with other ideas, 
which may seem equally absurd, 
it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable link.

The intellect 
cannot judge all these ideas unless it can retain them until it has 
considered them in connection with these other ideas.

In the case 
of a creative mind, 
it seems to me, 
the intellect has withdrawn its 
watchers from the gates, 
and the ideas rush in pell-mell, 
and only 
then does it review and inspect the multitude.

You worthy critics, 
or whatever you may call yourselves, 
are ashamed or afraid 
of the momentary and passing madness which is found in all 
real creators, 
the longer or shorter duration of which distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.

Hence your complaints of unfruitfulness, 
for you reject too soon and discriminate 
too severely (letter of December i, 
1788).

And yet, 
such a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of 
the intellect, 
as Schiller puts it, 
such a translation into the condition of uncritical self-observation, 
is by no means difficult.
 
Most of my patients accomplish it after my first instructions, 
myself can do so very completely, 
if I assist the process by writing down the ideas that flasli through my mind.

The quantum 
of psychic energy by which the critical activity is thus reduced,  
and by which the intensity of self-observation may be increased,  
varies considerably according to the subject-matter upon which 
the attention is to be fixed.

The first step in the application of this procedure teaches us 
that one cannot make the dream as a whole the object of one’s 
attention, 
but only the individual components of its content.
 
If I ask a patient who is as yet unpractised: What occurs to you 
in connection with this dream ?  he is unable, 
as a rule, 
to fix upon 
anything in his psychic field of vision.

I must first dissect the 
dream for him;
then, 
in connection with each fragment, 
he gives 
me a number of ideas which may be described as the thoughts 
behind this part of the dream.
In this first and important condition, 
then, 
the method of dream-interpretation which I employ 
diverges from the popular, 
historical and legendary method of 
interpretation by symbolism and approaches more nearly to the 
second or cipher method.
Like this, 
it is an interpretation in 
detail, 
not en masse;
like this, 
it conceives the dream, 
from tire 
outset, 
as something built up, 
as a conglomerate of psychic formations.
 

In the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics I have already 
subjected perhaps more than a thousand dreams to interpretation, 
but I do not wish to use this material now as an introduction to
the theory and technique of dream-interpretation.

For 
quite apart from the fact that I should lay myself open to the 
objection that these are the dreams of neuropaths, 
so that the 
conclusions drawn from them would not apply to the dreams of 
healthy persons, 
there is another reason that impels me to reject 
them.

The theme to which these dreams point is, 
of course, 
always the history of the malady that is responsible for the neurosis.

Hence every dream would require a very long introduction, 
and an investigation of the nature and etiological conditions 
of the psychoneuroses, 
matters which are in themselves novel 
and exceedingly strange, 
and which would therefore distract attention from the dream-problem proper.

My purpose is rather 
to prepare the way, 
by the solution of the dream-problem, 
for 
the solution of the more difficult problems of the psychology of 
the neuroses.

But if I eliminate the dreams of neurotics, 
which 
constitute my principal material, 
I cannot be too fastidious in 
my treatment of the rest.

Only those dreams are left which have 
been incidentally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, 
or which I find given as examples in the literature 
of dream-life.

Unfortunately, 
in all these dreams I am deprived 
of the analysis without which I cannot find the meaning of the 
dream.
My mode of procedure is, 
of course, 
less easy than that of 
the popular cipher method, 
which translates the given dreamcontent by reference to an established key;
I, 
on the contrary,  
hold that the same dream-content may conceal a different 
meaning in the case of different persons, 
or in different connections.

I must, 
therefore, 
resort to my own dreams as a source of 
abundant and convenient material, 
furnished by a person who 
is more or less normal, 
and containing references to many incidents of everyday life.
I shall certainly be confronted with doubts 
as to the trustworthiness of these self-analyses, 
and it will be 
said that arbitrariness is by no means excluded in such analyses.
 
In my own judgment, 
conditions are more likely to be favourable 
in self-observation than in the observation of others;
in any case,  
it is permissible to investigate how much can be accomplished in 
the matter of dream-interpretation by means of self-analysis.

There are other difficulties which must be overcome in my own 
inner self.
One has a comprehensible aversion to exposing so 
many intimate details of one’s own psychic life, 
and one does 
not feel secure against the misinterpretations of strangers.
But 
one must be able to transcend such considerations.
Tout psy ckologiste, 
writes Delbceuf, 
est obligi de jaire Vaveu meme de 
ses faiblesses s’il croit par Id jeter du jour sur quelque problbntc 
obscur And I may assume for the reader that his initial interest 
in the indiscretions which I must commit will very soon give way 
to an exclusive engrossment in the psychological problems elucidated by them. 

I shall therefore select one of my own dreams for the purpose 
of elucidating my method of interpretation.

Every such dream 
necessitates a preliminary statement;
so that I must now beg the 
reader to make my interests his own for a time, 
and to become 
absorbed, 
with me, 
in the most trifling details of my life;
for an 
interest in the hidden significance of dreams imperatively demands just such a transference.
 
In the summer of 1895 1 had treated psycho-analytically a young 
lady who was an intimate friend of mine and of my family.

It 
will be understood that such complicated relations may excite 
manifold feelings in the physician, 
and especially the psychotherapist.

The personal interest of the physician is greater, 
but his 
authority less.

If he fails, 
his friendship with the patient’s relatives is in danger of being undermined.
In this case, 
however,  
the treatment ended in partial success;
the patient was cured of 
her hysterical anxiety, 
but not of all her somatic symptoms.

At 
that time I was not yet quite sure of the criteria which denote 
the final cure of an hysterical case, 
and I expected her to accept 
a solution which did not seem acceptable to her.

In the midst of 
this disagreement we discontinued the treatment for the summer 
holidays.

One day a younger colleague, 
one of my most intimate 
friends, 
who had visited the patient — Irma — and her family in 
their country residence, 
called upon me.

I asked him how Irma 
was, 
and received the reply: She is better, 
but not quite well.
 
I realize that these words of my friend Otto’s, 
or the tone of voice 
in which they were spoken, 
annoyed me.

I thought I heard a reproach in the words, 
perhaps to the effect that I had promised 
the patient too much, 
and — rightly or wrongly — I attributed 
Otto’s apparent taking sides against me to the influence of the 
patient’s relatives, 
who, 
I assumed, 
had never approved of my 
treatment.

This disagreeable impression, 
however, 
did not become clear to me, 
nor did I speak of it.

That same evening I wrote 
the clinical history of Irma’s case, 
in order to give it, 
as though 
to justify myself, 
to Dr M,
a mutual friend, 
who was at that 
time the leading personality in our circle.

During the night
or rather in the early morning
I had the following dream, 
which I 
recorded immediately after waking:
Dream of July 23-24, 
1895 
A great hall — 
a number of guests, 
whom we are receiving — 
among them Irma, 
whom I immediately take aside, 
as though to 
answer her letter, 
and to reproach her for not yet accepting the 
solution  I say to her: If you still have pains, 
it is really only 
your own fault  — 
She answers: If you only knew what pains 
I have now in the throat, 
stomach, 
and abdomen— 
I am choked 
by them.

I am startled, 
and look at her.

She looks pale and 
This is the first dream which I subjected to an exhaustive interpretation.
 
puffy
think that after all I must be overlooking some organic 
affection.
I take her to the window and look into her throat.

She 
offers some, 
resistance to this, 
like, 
a woman who has a set of false 
teeth .

I think, 
surely, 
she, 
doesn’t need them.

The mouth then 
opens wide,  
and I find a large white spot on the right, 
and elsewhere 1 sec extensive, 
grayish-white scabs adhering to curiously 
curled formations, 
which are evidently shaped like the turbinal 
bones of the
nose.

I quickly call Dr M, 
who repeats the examination and confirms it.
Dr M looks quite unlike his usual self;
he is very pale, 
he limps, 
and his chin is clean-shaven.
 
Now my friend Otto, 
too, 
is standing beside her, 
and my friend 
Leopold percusses her covered chest, 
and says: She has a dullness below, 
on the left, 
and also calls attention to an infiltrated 
portion of skin on the left shoulder ( which I can feel, 
in spite of 
the dress).
M says:  There’s no doubt that it’s an infection,  
but it doesn’t matter;
dysentery will follow and the poison will 
be eliminated.

We know, 
too, 
precisely how the infection 
originated.

My friend Otto, 
not long ago, 
gave her, 
when she was 
feeling unwell, 
an injection of a preparation of propyl,
propyls, 
propionic acid, 
trimelhylamin, 
the formula of which I see before me, 
printed in heavy type.

One doesn’t give 
such injections so rashly, 
Probably, 
too, 
the syringe was not 
clean.
 
This dream has an advantage over many others.

It is at once 
obvious to what events of the preceding day it is related, 
and of 
what subject it treats.

The preliminary statement explains these 
matters.

The news of Inna’s health which I had received from 
Otto, 
and the clinical history, 
which I was writing late into the 
night, 
had occupied my psychic activities even during sleep.
 
Nevertheless, 
no one who had read the preliminary report, 
and 
had knowledge of the content of the dream, 
could guess what 
the dream signified.

Nor do I myself know.

I am puzzled by the 
morbid symptoms of which Irma complains in the dream, 
for 
they are not the symptoms for which I treated her.

I smile at 
the nonsensical idea of an injection of propionic acid, 
and at Dr M’s attempt at consolation.

Towards the end the dream seems 
more obscure and quicker in tempo than at the beginning.

In 
order to learn the significance of all these details I resolve to 
undertake an exhaustive analysis.
 
The hall — a number of guests, 
whom we arc receiving.
We were 
living that summer at Bellevue, 
an isolated house on one of the 
hills adjoining the Kahlenberg.
This house was originally built 
as a place of entertainment, 
and therefore has unusually lofty, 
hall-lilce rooms.

The dream was dreamed in Bellevue, 
a few days 
before my wife’s birthday.

During the day my wife had mentioned that she expected several friends, 
and among them Irma, 
 to come to us as guests for her birthday.

My dream, 
then, 
anticipates this situation: It is my wife’s birthday, 
and we are receiving a number of people, 
among them Irma, 
as guests in the 
large hall of Bellevue. 
 
I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution, 
I say, 
If you still have pains, 
it is really your own fault I might even 
have said this while awake;
I may have actually said it.

At that 
time I was of the opinion recognized (later to be incorrect) that 
my task was limited to informing patients of the hidden meaning 
of their symptoms.

Whether they then accepted or did not accept 
the solution upon which success depended — for that I was not 
responsible.

I am grateful to this error, 
which, 
fortunately, 
has 
now been overcome, 
since it made life easier for me at a time 
when, 
with all my unavoidable ignorance, 
I was expected to effect 
successful cures.

But I note that in the speech which I make to 
Irma in the dream I am above all anxious that I shall not be 
blamed for the pains which she still sufiers.

If it is Irma’s own 
fault, 
it cannot be mine.

Should the purpose of the dream be 
looked for in this quarter? 

Irma's complaints —
pains in the neck, 
abdomen, 
and stomach;
she is choked by them.

Pains in the stomach belonged to the 
symptom-complex of my patient, 
but they were not very prominent;
she complained rather of qualms and a feeling of nausea.
 
Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of the throat 
played hardly any part in her case.

I wonder why I have decided 
upon this choice of symptoms in the dream;
for the moment I 
cannot discover the reason.

She looks pale and puffy.

My patient had always a rosy complexion.

I suspect that here another person is being substituted 
for her.

I am startled at the idea that I may have overlooked some or ganic affection.

This, 
as the reader will readily believe, 
is a constant fear with the specialist who sees neurotics almost exclusively, 
and who is accustomed to ascribe to hysteria so many
manifestations which other physicians treat as organic.

On the other 
hand, 
I am haunted by a faint doubt — I do not know whence 
it comes — -whether my alarm is altogether honest.

If Irma’s pains 
are indeed of organic origin, 
it is not my duty to cure them.

My treatment, 
of course, 
removes only hysterical pains.

It seems to me, 
in fact, 
that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis;
for then 
I could not be reproached with failure to effect a cure.
 
I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. 
She resists a little, 
like a woman who has false teeth.
I think to myself, 
 
she does not need them.
I had never had occasion to inspect 
Irma’s oral cavity.

The incident in the dream reminds me of an 
examination, 
made some time before, 
of a governess who at first 
produced an impression of youthful beauty, 
but who, 
upon opening her mouth, 
took certain measures to conceal her denture.
 
Other memories of medical examinations, 
and of petty secrets 
revealed by them, 
to the embarrassment of both physician and 
patient, 
associate themselves with this case.

She surely does 
not need them, 
is perhaps in the first place a compliment to 
Irma;
but I suspect yet another meaning.

In a careful analysis 
one is able to feel whether or not the arriere-pensees which are 
to be expected have all been exhausted.

The way in which Irma 
stands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience.
 
Irma has an intimate woman friend of whom I think very highly.
 
One evening, 
on paying her a visit, 
I found her at the window in 
the position reproduced in the dream, 
and her physician, 
the same Dr M,
declared that she had a diphtheritic membrane.
 
The person of Dr M
and the membrane return, 
indeed, 
in the 
course of the dream.

Now it occurs to me that during the past 
few months I have had every reason to suppose that this lady too 
is hysterical.

Yes, 
Irma herself betrayed the fact to me.
