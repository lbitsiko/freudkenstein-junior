In the following pages, 
I shall demonstrate that there is a 
psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, 
and that on the application of this technique, 
every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, 
full of significance, 
and one which may be assigned to a specific place in 
the psychic activities of the waking state.
Further, 
I shall endeavor to elucidate the processes which underlie the strangeness 
and obscurity of dreams, 
and to deduce from these processes the 
nature of the psychic forces whose conflict or co-operation is responsible for our dreams.
This done, 
my investigation will terminate, 
as it will have reached the point where the problem of 
the dream merges into more comprehensive problems, 
and to solve these, 
we must have recourse to material of a different kind.
 

I shall begin by giving a short account of the views of earlier 
writers on this subject and of the status of the dream-problem 
in contemporary science;
since in the course of this treatise, 
I shall not often have occasion to refer to either.
In spite of thousands of years of endeavor, 
little progress has been made in the 
scientific understanding of dreams.
This fact has been so universally acknowledged by previous writers on the subject that it 
seems hardly necessary to quote individual opinions.
The reader 
will find, 
in many stimulating observations, 
and plenty of interesting material relating to our subject, 
but little or nothing that 
concerns the true nature of the dream, 
or that solves definitely any of its enigmas.

The educated layman, 
of course, 
knows even 
less of the matter.
 

The conception of the dream that was held in prehistoric ages 
by primitive peoples, 
and the influence which it may have exerted on the formation of their conceptions of the universe, 
and of the soul, 
is a theme of such great interest that it is only with 
reluctance that I refrain from dealing with it in these pages.
I will refer the reader to the well-known works of Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury), 
Herbert Spencer, 
E.
B.
Tylor and other 
writers;
I will only add that we shall not realize the importance 
of these problems and speculations until we have completed 
the task of dream interpretation that lies before us.
 

A reminiscence of the concept of the dream that was held in 
primitive times seems to underlie the evaluation of the dream 
which was current among the peoples of classical antiquity .
 1 
They took it for granted that dreams were related to the world 
of the supernatural beings in whom they believed, 
and that they brought inspirations from the gods and demons.
Moreover, 
it appeared to them that dreams must serve a special purpose in 
respect of the dreamer;
that, 
as a rule, 
they predicted the future.
 
The extraordinary variations in the content of dreams, 
and in the impressions which they produced on the dreamer, 
made it, 
of course, 
very difficult to formulate a coherent conception of them, 
and necessitated manifold differentiations and group-formations, 
according to their value and reliability.

The valuation of dreams 
by the individual philosophers of antiquity naturally depended 
on the importance which they were prepared to attribute to 
manticism in general.
 

In the two works of Aristotle in which there is mention of 
dreams, 
they are already regarded as constituting a problem of 
psychology.

We are told that the dream is not god-sent, 
that 
it is not of divine but of daimonic origin.

For nature is really 
daimonic, 
not divine;
that is to say, 
the dream is not a supernatural revelation, 
but is subject to the laws of the human spirit,  
which has, 
of course, 
a kinship with the divine.

The dream is 
defined as the psychic activity of the sleeper, 
inasmuch as he is 
asleep.

Aristotle was acquainted with some of the characteristics 
of the dream-life;
for example, 
he knew that a dream converts 
the slight sensations perceived in sleep into intense sensations 
(one imagines that one is walking through fire, 
and feels hot,  
if this or that part of the body becomes only quite slightly 
warm), 
which led him to conclude that dreams might easily 
betray to the physician the first indications of an incipient physical change which escaped observation during the day. 

As has been said, 
those writers of antiquity who preceded 
Aristotle did not regard the dream as a product of the dreaming 
psyche, 
but as an inspiration of divine origin, 
and in ancient times, 
the two opposing tendencies which we shall find throughout the ages in respect of the evaluation of the dream-life, 
were already perceptible.

The ancients distinguished between the 
true and valuable dreams which were sent to the dreamer as 
warnings, 
or to foretell future events, 
and the vain, 
fraudulent 
and empty dreams, 
whose object was to misguide him or lead him 
to destruction.
 

The pre-scientific conception of the dream which obtained 
among the ancients was, 
of course, 
in perfect keeping with their 
general conception of the universe, 
which was accustomed to 
project as an external reality that which possessed reality only 
in the life of the psyche.

Further, 
it accounted for the main impression made upon the waking life by the morning memory 
of the dream;
for in this memory the dream, 
as compared with the rest of the psychic content, 
seems to be something alien, 
coming, 
as it were, 
from another world.
It would be an error to 
suppose that the theory of the supernatural origin of dreams 
lacks followers even in our own times;
for quite apart from 
pietistic and mystical writers — who cling, 
as they are perfectly justified in doing, 
to the remnants of the once predominant realm of the supernatural until these remnants have been swept 
away by scientific explanation — we not infrequently find that 
quite intelligent persons, 
 who in other respects are averse to 
anything of a romantic nature, 
 go so far as to base their religious 
belief in the existence and co-operation of superhuman spiritual 
powers on the inexplicable nature of the phenomena of dreams (Haffner).

The validity ascribed to the dream life by certain 
schools of philosophy — 
for example, 
by the school of Schelling — 
is a distinct reminiscence of the undisputed belief in the divinity 
of dreams which prevailed in antiquity;
and for some thinkers, 
the mantic or prophetic power of dreams is still a subject of debate.

This is due to the fact that the explanations attempted 
by psychology are too inadequate to cope with the accumulated material, 
however strongly the scientific thinker may feel that 
such superstitious doctrines should be repudiated.
 

To write a history of our scientific knowledge of the dream 
problem is extremely difficult, 
because, 
valuable though this knowledge may be in certain respects, 
no real progress in a definite direction is as yet discernible.
No real foundation of verified results has hitherto been established
on which future investigators might continue to build.

Every new author approaches 
the same problems afresh, 
and from the very beginning.
If I were to enumerate such authors in chronological order, 
giving a survey of the opinions which each has held concerning the problems of the dream, 
I should be quite unable to draw a clear and 
complete picture of the present state of our knowledge on the 
subject.

I have therefore preferred to base my method of treatment on themes rather than on authors, 
and in attempting the solution of each problem of the dream, 
I shall cite the material found in the literature of the subject.
 
But as I have not succeeded in mastering the whole of this literature —
for it is widely dispersed and interwoven with the literature of other subjects —
I must ask my readers to rest content 
with my survey as it stands, 
provided that no fundamental fact 
or important point of view has been overlooked.
 

In a supplement to a later German edition, 
the author adds: 
I shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary 
of the literature of dream problems to cover the period between 
first appearance of this book and the publication of the second 
edition.

This justification may not seem very satisfactory to the reader;
none the less, 
to me it was decisive.

The motives which 
induced me to summarize the treatment of dreams in the literature 
of the subject have been exhausted by the foregoing introduction;
to have continued this would have cost me a great deal 
of effort and would not have been particularly useful or instructive.

For the interval in question —
a period of nine years —
has yielded nothing new or valuable as regards the conception of dreams, 
either in actual material or in novel points of view.
In most of the literature which has appeared since the publication of my own work, 
the latter has not been mentioned or discussed; 
it has, 
of course, 
received the least attention from the so-called 
research workers on dreams, 
who have thus afforded a brilliant example of the aversion
to learning anything new so characteristic of the scientist.

Les savants ne sont pas curieux, 
said the scoffer, 
Anatole France.

If there were such a thing in 
science as the right of revenge, 
I, 
in my turn, 
should be justified 
in ignoring the literature which has appeared since the publication of this book.

The few reviews which have appeared in the 
scientific journals are so full of misconceptions and lack of comprehension that
my only possible answer to my critics would be
a request that they should read this book over again — or perhaps 
merely that they should read it I 

And in a supplement to the fourth German edition which appeared in 1914, 
a year after I published the first English translation of this work, 
he writes: 

Since then, 
the state of affairs has certainly undergone a 
change;
my contribution to the interpretation of dreams is no longer ignored in the literature of the subject.

But the new situation makes it even more impossible to continue the foregoing summary.

The Interpretation of Dreams has evoked a whole 
series of new contentions and problems, 
which have been expounded by the authors in the most varied fashions.
But I cannot discuss these works until I have developed the theories to 
which their authors have referred.

Whatever has appeared to me 
as valuable in this recent literature, 
I have accordingly reviewed 
in the course of the following exposition.
 
The epigraph on the title-page of this volume indicates the tradition
to which
I prefer to ally myself in my conception of the
dream.

I am proposing to show that dreams are capable of interpretation;
and any contributions to the solution of the problem 
which have already been discussed will emerge only as possible 
by-products in the accomplishment of my special task.
On the hypothesis that dreams are susceptible of interpretation, 
I at once find myself in disagreement with the prevailing doctrine of 
dreams —
in fact, 
with all the theories of dreams, 
excepting only that of Schemer, 
for to interpret a dream,
is to specify its meaning, 
to replace it by something which takes its position 
in the concatenation of our psychic activities as a link of definite 
importance and value.

But, 
as we have seen, 
the scientific theories 
of the dream leave no room for a problem of dream-interpretation;
since, 
in the first place, 
according to these theories, 
dreaming is not a psychic activity at all, 
but a somatic process which 
makes itself known to the psychic apparatus by means of symbols.

Lay opinion has always been opposed to these theories.
It asserts its privilege of proceeding illogically, 
and although it 
admits that dreams are incomprehensible and absurd, 
it cannot 
summon up the courage to deny that dreams have any significance.

Led by a dim intuition, 
it seems rather to assume that 
dreams have a meaning, 
albeit a hidden one;
that they are intended 
as a substitute for some other thought-process, 
and that 
we have only to disclose this substitute correctly in order to 
discover the hidden meaning of the dream.
 
The unscientific world, 
therefore, 
has always endeavored to 
interpret dreams, 
and by applying one or the other of two 
essentially different methods.

The first of these methods envisages the dream-content as a whole, 
and seeks to replace it by 
another content, 
which is intelligible and in certain respects analogous.

This is symbolic dream-interpretation;
and of course it 
goes to pieces at the very outset in the case of those dreams 
which are not only unintelligible but confused.

The construction 
which the biblical Joseph placed upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of this method.

The seven fat ldne, 
after which 
came seven lean ones that devoured the former, 
were a symbolic 
substitute for seven years of famine in the land of Egypt, 
which 
according to the prediction were to consume all the surplus that 
seven fruitful years had produced.

Most of the artificial dreams 
contrived by the poets 1 are intended for some such symbolic interpretation, 
for they reproduce the thought conceived by the 
poet in a guise not unlike the disguise which we are wont to find 
in our dreams.
 
The idea that the dream concerns itself chiefly with the future, 
whose form it surmises in advance —
a relic of the prophetic significance with which dreams were once invested —
now becomes 
the motive for translating into the future the meaning of the 
dream which has been found by means of symbolic interpretation. 

A demonstration of the manner in which one arrives at such a 
symbolic interpretation cannot, 
of course, 
be given.

Success remains a matter of ingenious conjecture, 
of direct intuition, 
and for this reason dream-interpretation has naturally been elevated 
into an art which seems to depend upon extraordinary gifts.

The second of the two popular methods of dream-interpretation entirely abandons such claims.
It might be described as the cipher method, 
since it treats the dream as a kind of secret code in 
which every sign is translated into another sign of known meaning, 
according to an established key.

For example, 
I have dreamt 
of a letter, 
and also of a funeral or the like;
I consult a dreambook, 
33 and I find that letter 3 is to be translated by vexation 33 
and funeral 33 by engagement.

It now remains to establish 
a connection, 
which I am again to assume as pertaining to the 
future, 
by means of the rigmarole which I have deciphered.

An 
interesting variant of this cipher procedure, 
a variant in which 
its character of purely mechanical transference is to a certain 
extent corrected, 
is presented in the work on dream-interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis .

Here not only the dream-content, 
but also the personality and social position of the dreamer are 
taken into consideration, 
so that the same dream-content has a 
significance for the rich man, 
the married man, 
or the orator,  
which is different from that which applies to the poor man, 
the bachelor, 
or, 
let us say, 
the merchant.

The essential point, 
then,  
in this procedure is that the work of interpretation is not applied 
to the entirety of the dream, 
but to each portion of the dreamcontent severally, 
as though the dream were a conglomerate in 
which each fragment calls for special treatment.

Incoherent and 
confused dreams are certaintly those that have been responsible 
for the invention of the cipher method .

The worthlessness of both these popular methods of interprewriter relates as follows:
Pour inter pr iter exactement un songe les onirom anciens

as well as the following formula: 
habistine in hoc node copulam 
conjugalem ante vel post somnium? —
L’idSe dominante dans Vinter prita tion des songes consiste a expliquer le reve par son oppose. 

talion does not admit of discussion.

As regards the scientific 
treatment of the subject, 
the symbolic method is limited in its 
application, 
and is not susceptible of a general exposition.

In the 
cipher method everything depends upon whether the key, 
the dream-book, 
is reliable, 
and for that all guarantees are lacking.
 
So that one might be tempted to grant the contention of the 
philosophers and psychiatrists, 
and to dismiss the problem of 
dream-interpretation as altogether fanciful.

I have, 
however, 
come to think differently.

I have been forced 
to perceive that here, 
once more, 
we have one of those not infrequent cases where an ancient and stubbornly retained popular 
belief seems to have come nearer to the truth of the matter than 
the opinion of modern science.

I must insist that the dream actually does possess a meaning, 
and that a scientific method of 
dream-interpretation is possible.
I arrived at my knowledge of 
this method in the following manner: 
For years I have been occupied with the resolution of certain 
psychopathological structures — hysterical phobias, 
obsessional ideas, 
and the like— 
with therapeutic intentions.

I have been so 
occupied, 
in fact, 
ever since I heard the significant statement of Joseph Breuer, 
to the effect that in these structures, 
regarded as 
morbid symptoms, 
solution and treatment go hand in hand.
 
Where it has been possible to trace a pathological idea back to 
those elements in the psychic life of the patient to which it owed 
its origin, 
this idea has crumbled away, 
and the patient has been 
relieved of it.

In view of the failure of our other therapeutic 
efforts, 
and in the face of the mysterious character of these pathological conditions, 
it seemed to me tempting, 
in spite of all the 
difficulties, 
to follow the method initiated by Breuer until a 
complete elucidation of the subject had been achieved.

I shall 
have occasion elsewhere to give a detailed account of the form
which the technique of this procedure has finally assumed, 
and of 
the results of my efforts.
In the course of these psychoanalytic 
studies, 
I happened upon the question of dream-interpretation.
 
My patients, 
after I had pledged them to inform me of all the 
ideas and thoughts which occurred to them in connection with 
a given theme, 
related their dreams, 
and thus taught me that a 
dream may be interpolated in the psychic concatenation, 
which may be followed backwards from a pathological idea into a patient’s memory.
The next step was to treat the dream itself as a 
symptom, 
and to apply to it the method of interpretation which 
had been worked out for such symptoms.
 
For this a certain psychic preparation on the part of the patient is necessary.
A twofold effort is made, 
to stimulate his attentiveness in respect of his psychic perceptions, 
and to eliminate 
the critical spirit in which he is ordinarily in the habit of viewing such thoughts as come to the surface.

For the purpose of selfobservation with concentrated attention it is advantageous that 
the patient should take up a restful position and close his eyes;
 he must be explicitly instructed to renounce all criticism of the 
thought formations which he may perceive.

He must also be 
told that the success of the psychoanalysis depends upon his noting and communicating
everything that passes through his mind,
and that he must not allow himself to suppress one idea because 
it seems to him unimportant or irrelevant to the subject, 
or another because it seems nonsensical.

He must preserve an absolute 
impartiality in respect to his ideas;
for if he is unsuccessful in 
finding the desired solution of the dream, 
the obsessional idea, 
or the like, 
it will be because he permits himself to be critical of 
them.
 
I have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytical work that 
the psychological state of a man in an attitude of reflection is 
entirely different from that of a man who is observing his psychic 
processes.

In reflection there is a greater play of psychic activity 
than in the most attentive self-observation;
this is shown even by 
the tense attitude and the wrinkled brow of the man in a state of 
reflection, 
as opposed to the mimic tranquillity of the man observing himself.

In both cases there must be concentrated attention, 
but the reflective man makes use of his critical faculties, 
with the result that he rejects some of the thoughts which rise into 
consciousness after he has become aware of them, 
and abruptly 
interrupts others, 
so that he does not follow the lines of thought 
which they would otherwise open up for him;
while in respect of 
yet other thoughts he is able to behave in such a manner that they 
do not become conscious at all — 
that is to say, 
they are suppressed before they are perceived.

In self-observation, 
on the other hand, 
he has but one task — that of suppressing criticism; 
if he succeeds in doing this, 
an unlimited number of thoughts 
enter his consciousness which would otherwise have eluded his 
grasp.

With the aid of the material thus obtained — material 
which is new to the self-observer — it is possible to achieve the interpretation of pathological ideas, 
and also that of dream-formations.
As will be seen, 
the point is to induce a psychic state which 
is in some degree analogous, 
as regards the distribution of psychic 
energy (mobile attention), 
to the state of the mind before falling 
asleep —
and also, 
of course, 
to the hypnotic state.

On falling 
asleep the undesired ideas emerge, 
owing to the slackening of 
a certain arbitrary (and, 
of course, 
also critical) action, 
which 
is allowed to influence the trend of our ideas;
we are accustomed 
to speak of fatigue as the reason of this slackening;
the merging 
undesired ideas are changed into visual and auditory images.

In the condition which it utilized for the analysis of dreams and 
pathological ideas, 
this activity is purposely and deliberately 
renounced, 
and the psychic energy thus saved (or some part of it) is employed
in attentively tracking the undesired thoughts
which now come to the surface — thoughts which retain their 
identity as ideas (in which the condition differs from the state 
of falling asleep).

Undesired ideas are thus changed into desired ones.

There are many people who do not seem to find it easy to adopt 
the required attitude toward the apparently freely rising ideas,  
and to renounce the criticism which is otherwise applied to them.

The undesired ideas habitually evoke the most violent resistance, 
which seeks to prevent them from coming to the surface.
 
But if we may credit our great poet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller, 
the essential condition of poetical creation includes a very 
similar attitude.

In a certain passage in his correspondence with 
Korner (for the tracing of which we are indebted to Otto Rank),  
Schiller replies in the following words to a friend who complains 
of his lack of creative power: The reason for your complaint lies, 
it seems to me, 
in the constraint which your intellect imposes 
upon your imagination.

Here I will make an observation, 
and illustrate it by an allegory.

Apparently it is not good — and indeed it hinders the creative work of the mind — if the intellect 
examines too closely the ideas already pouring in, 
as it were, 
at the gates.

Regarded in isolation, 
an idea may be quite insignificant, 
and venturesome in the extreme, 
but it may acquire importance from an idea which follows it;
perhaps, 
in a certain collocation with other ideas, 
which may seem equally absurd, 
it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable link.

The intellect 
cannot judge all these ideas unless it can retain them until it has 
considered them in connection with these other ideas.

In the case 
of a creative mind, 
it seems to me, 
the intellect has withdrawn its 
watchers from the gates, 
and the ideas rush in pell-mell, 
and only 
then does it review and inspect the multitude.

You worthy critics, 
or whatever you may call yourselves, 
are ashamed or afraid 
of the momentary and passing madness which is found in all 
real creators, 
the longer or shorter duration of which distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.

Hence your complaints of unfruitfulness, 
for you reject too soon and discriminate 
too severely (letter of December i, 
1788).

And yet, 
such a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of 
the intellect, 
as Schiller puts it, 
such a translation into the condition of uncritical self-observation, 
is by no means difficult.
 
Most of my patients accomplish it after my first instructions, 
myself can do so very completely, 
if I assist the process by writing down the ideas that flasli through my mind.

The quantum 
of psychic energy by which the critical activity is thus reduced,  
and by which the intensity of self-observation may be increased,  
varies considerably according to the subject-matter upon which 
the attention is to be fixed.

The first step in the application of this procedure teaches us 
that one cannot make the dream as a whole the object of one’s 
attention, 
but only the individual components of its content.
 
If I ask a patient who is as yet unpractised: What occurs to you 
in connection with this dream ?  he is unable, 
as a rule, 
to fix upon 
anything in his psychic field of vision.

I must first dissect the 
dream for him;
then, 
in connection with each fragment, 
he gives 
me a number of ideas which may be described as the thoughts 
behind this part of the dream.
In this first and important condition, 
then, 
the method of dream-interpretation which I employ 
diverges from the popular, 
historical and legendary method of 
interpretation by symbolism and approaches more nearly to the 
second or cipher method.
Like this, 
it is an interpretation in 
detail, 
not en masse;
like this, 
it conceives the dream, 
from tire 
outset, 
as something built up, 
as a conglomerate of psychic formations.
 

In the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics I have already 
subjected perhaps more than a thousand dreams to interpretation, 
but I do not wish to use this material now as an introduction to
the theory and technique of dream-interpretation.

For 
quite apart from the fact that I should lay myself open to the 
objection that these are the dreams of neuropaths, 
so that the 
conclusions drawn from them would not apply to the dreams of 
healthy persons, 
there is another reason that impels me to reject 
them.

The theme to which these dreams point is, 
of course, 
always the history of the malady that is responsible for the neurosis.

Hence every dream would require a very long introduction, 
and an investigation of the nature and etiological conditions 
of the psychoneuroses, 
matters which are in themselves novel 
and exceedingly strange, 
and which would therefore distract attention from the dream-problem proper.

My purpose is rather 
to prepare the way, 
by the solution of the dream-problem, 
for 
the solution of the more difficult problems of the psychology of 
the neuroses.

But if I eliminate the dreams of neurotics, 
which 
constitute my principal material, 
I cannot be too fastidious in 
my treatment of the rest.

Only those dreams are left which have 
been incidentally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, 
or which I find given as examples in the literature 
of dream-life.

Unfortunately, 
in all these dreams I am deprived 
of the analysis without which I cannot find the meaning of the 
dream.
My mode of procedure is, 
of course, 
less easy than that of 
the popular cipher method, 
which translates the given dreamcontent by reference to an established key;
I, 
on the contrary,  
hold that the same dream-content may conceal a different 
meaning in the case of different persons, 
or in different connections.

I must, 
therefore, 
resort to my own dreams as a source of 
abundant and convenient material, 
furnished by a person who 
is more or less normal, 
and containing references to many incidents of everyday life.
I shall certainly be confronted with doubts 
as to the trustworthiness of these self-analyses, 
and it will be 
said that arbitrariness is by no means excluded in such analyses.
 
In my own judgment, 
conditions are more likely to be favourable 
in self-observation than in the observation of others;
in any case,  
it is permissible to investigate how much can be accomplished in 
the matter of dream-interpretation by means of self-analysis.

There are other difficulties which must be overcome in my own 
inner self.
One has a comprehensible aversion to exposing so 
many intimate details of one’s own psychic life, 
and one does 
not feel secure against the misinterpretations of strangers.
But 
one must be able to transcend such considerations.
Tout psy ckologiste, 
writes Delbceuf, 
est obligi de jaire Vaveu meme de 
ses faiblesses s’il croit par Id jeter du jour sur quelque problbntc 
obscur And I may assume for the reader that his initial interest 
in the indiscretions which I must commit will very soon give way 
to an exclusive engrossment in the psychological problems elucidated by them. 

I shall therefore select one of my own dreams for the purpose 
of elucidating my method of interpretation.

Every such dream 
necessitates a preliminary statement;
so that I must now beg the 
reader to make my interests his own for a time, 
and to become 
absorbed, 
with me, 
in the most trifling details of my life;
for an 
interest in the hidden significance of dreams imperatively demands just such a transference.
 
In the summer of 1895 1 had treated psycho-analytically a young 
lady who was an intimate friend of mine and of my family.

It 
will be understood that such complicated relations may excite 
manifold feelings in the physician, 
and especially the psychotherapist.

The personal interest of the physician is greater, 
but his 
authority less.

If he fails, 
his friendship with the patient’s relatives is in danger of being undermined.
In this case, 
however,  
the treatment ended in partial success;
the patient was cured of 
her hysterical anxiety, 
but not of all her somatic symptoms.

At 
that time I was not yet quite sure of the criteria which denote 
the final cure of an hysterical case, 
and I expected her to accept 
a solution which did not seem acceptable to her.

In the midst of 
this disagreement we discontinued the treatment for the summer 
holidays.

One day a younger colleague, 
one of my most intimate 
friends, 
who had visited the patient — Irma — and her family in 
their country residence, 
called upon me.

I asked him how Irma 
was, 
and received the reply: She is better, 
but not quite well.
 
I realize that these words of my friend Otto’s, 
or the tone of voice 
in which they were spoken, 
annoyed me.

I thought I heard a reproach in the words, 
perhaps to the effect that I had promised 
the patient too much, 
and — rightly or wrongly — I attributed 
Otto’s apparent taking sides against me to the influence of the 
patient’s relatives, 
who, 
I assumed, 
had never approved of my 
treatment.

This disagreeable impression, 
however, 
did not become clear to me, 
nor did I speak of it.

That same evening I wrote 
the clinical history of Irma’s case, 
in order to give it, 
as though 
to justify myself, 
to Dr M,
a mutual friend, 
who was at that 
time the leading personality in our circle.

During the night
or rather in the early morning
I had the following dream, 
which I 
recorded immediately after waking:
Dream of July 23-24, 
1895 
A great hall — 
a number of guests, 
whom we are receiving — 
among them Irma, 
whom I immediately take aside, 
as though to 
answer her letter, 
and to reproach her for not yet accepting the 
solution  I say to her: If you still have pains, 
it is really only 
your own fault  — 
She answers: If you only knew what pains 
I have now in the throat, 
stomach, 
and abdomen— 
I am choked 
by them.

I am startled, 
and look at her.

She looks pale and 
This is the first dream which I subjected to an exhaustive interpretation.
 
puffy
think that after all I must be overlooking some organic 
affection.
I take her to the window and look into her throat.

She 
offers some, 
resistance to this, 
like, 
a woman who has a set of false 
teeth .

I think, 
surely, 
she, 
doesn’t need them.

The mouth then 
opens wide,  
and I find a large white spot on the right, 
and elsewhere 1 sec extensive, 
grayish-white scabs adhering to curiously 
curled formations, 
which are evidently shaped like the turbinal 
bones of the
nose.

I quickly call Dr M, 
who repeats the examination and confirms it.
Dr M looks quite unlike his usual self;
he is very pale, 
he limps, 
and his chin is clean-shaven.
 
Now my friend Otto, 
too, 
is standing beside her, 
and my friend 
Leopold percusses her covered chest, 
and says: She has a dullness below, 
on the left, 
and also calls attention to an infiltrated 
portion of skin on the left shoulder ( which I can feel, 
in spite of 
the dress).
M says:  There’s no doubt that it’s an infection,  
but it doesn’t matter;
dysentery will follow and the poison will 
be eliminated.

We know, 
too, 
precisely how the infection 
originated.

My friend Otto, 
not long ago, 
gave her, 
when she was 
feeling unwell, 
an injection of a preparation of propyl,
propyls, 
propionic acid, 
trimelhylamin, 
the formula of which I see before me, 
printed in heavy type.

One doesn’t give 
such injections so rashly, 
Probably, 
too, 
the syringe was not 
clean.
 
This dream has an advantage over many others.

It is at once 
obvious to what events of the preceding day it is related, 
and of 
what subject it treats.

The preliminary statement explains these 
matters.

The news of Inna’s health which I had received from 
Otto, 
and the clinical history, 
which I was writing late into the 
night, 
had occupied my psychic activities even during sleep.
 
Nevertheless, 
no one who had read the preliminary report, 
and 
had knowledge of the content of the dream, 
could guess what 
the dream signified.

Nor do I myself know.

I am puzzled by the 
morbid symptoms of which Irma complains in the dream, 
for 
they are not the symptoms for which I treated her.

I smile at 
the nonsensical idea of an injection of propionic acid, 
and at Dr M’s attempt at consolation.

Towards the end the dream seems 
more obscure and quicker in tempo than at the beginning.

In 
order to learn the significance of all these details I resolve to 
undertake an exhaustive analysis.
 
The hall — a number of guests, 
whom we arc receiving.
We were 
living that summer at Bellevue, 
an isolated house on one of the 
hills adjoining the Kahlenberg.
This house was originally built 
as a place of entertainment, 
and therefore has unusually lofty, 
hall-lilce rooms.

The dream was dreamed in Bellevue, 
a few days 
before my wife’s birthday.

During the day my wife had mentioned that she expected several friends, 
and among them Irma, 
 to come to us as guests for her birthday.

My dream, 
then, 
anticipates this situation: It is my wife’s birthday, 
and we are receiving a number of people, 
among them Irma, 
as guests in the 
large hall of Bellevue. 
 
I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution, 
I say, 
If you still have pains, 
it is really your own fault I might even 
have said this while awake;
I may have actually said it.

At that 
time I was of the opinion recognized (later to be incorrect) that 
my task was limited to informing patients of the hidden meaning 
of their symptoms.

Whether they then accepted or did not accept 
the solution upon which success depended — for that I was not 
responsible.

I am grateful to this error, 
which, 
fortunately, 
has 
now been overcome, 
since it made life easier for me at a time 
when, 
with all my unavoidable ignorance, 
I was expected to effect 
successful cures.

But I note that in the speech which I make to 
Irma in the dream I am above all anxious that I shall not be 
blamed for the pains which she still sufiers.

If it is Irma’s own 
fault, 
it cannot be mine.

Should the purpose of the dream be 
looked for in this quarter? 

Irma's complaints —
pains in the neck, 
abdomen, 
and stomach;
she is choked by them.

Pains in the stomach belonged to the 
symptom-complex of my patient, 
but they were not very prominent;
she complained rather of qualms and a feeling of nausea.
 
Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of the throat 
played hardly any part in her case.

I wonder why I have decided 
upon this choice of symptoms in the dream;
for the moment I 
cannot discover the reason.

She looks pale and puffy.

My patient had always a rosy complexion.

I suspect that here another person is being substituted 
for her.

I am startled at the idea that I may have overlooked some or ganic affection.

This, 
as the reader will readily believe, 
is a constant fear with the specialist who sees neurotics almost exclusively, 
and who is accustomed to ascribe to hysteria so many
manifestations which other physicians treat as organic.

On the other 
hand, 
I am haunted by a faint doubt — I do not know whence 
it comes — -whether my alarm is altogether honest.

If Irma’s pains 
are indeed of organic origin, 
it is not my duty to cure them.

My treatment, 
of course, 
removes only hysterical pains.

It seems to me, 
in fact, 
that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis;
for then 
I could not be reproached with failure to effect a cure.
 
I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. 
She resists a little, 
like a woman who has false teeth.
I think to myself, 
 
she does not need them.
I had never had occasion to inspect 
Irma’s oral cavity.

The incident in the dream reminds me of an 
examination, 
made some time before, 
of a governess who at first 
produced an impression of youthful beauty, 
but who, 
upon opening her mouth, 
took certain measures to conceal her denture.
 
Other memories of medical examinations, 
and of petty secrets 
revealed by them, 
to the embarrassment of both physician and 
patient, 
associate themselves with this case.

She surely does 
not need them, 
is perhaps in the first place a compliment to 
Irma;
but I suspect yet another meaning.

In a careful analysis 
one is able to feel whether or not the arriere-pensees which are 
to be expected have all been exhausted.

The way in which Irma 
stands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience.
 
Irma has an intimate woman friend of whom I think very highly.
 
One evening, 
on paying her a visit, 
I found her at the window in 
the position reproduced in the dream, 
and her physician, 
the same Dr M,
declared that she had a diphtheritic membrane.
 
The person of Dr M
and the membrane return, 
indeed, 
in the 
course of the dream.

Now it occurs to me that during the past 
few months I have had every reason to suppose that this lady too 
is hysterical.

Yes, 
Irma herself betrayed the fact to me.

But what 
do I know of her condition? Only the one thing, 
that like Irma 
in the dream she suffers from hysterical choking.

Thus, 
in the 
dream I have replaced my patient by her friend.

Now I remember that I have often played with the supposition that this lady, 
too, 
might ask me to relieve her of her symptoms.

But even at the 
time I thought it improbable since she is extremely reserved.

She 
resists, 
as the dream shows.

Another explanation might be that 
she does not need it;
in fact, 
until now she has shown herself 
strong enough to master her condition without outside help.

Now 
only a few features remain, 
which I can assign neither to Irma 
nor to her friend;
pale, 
puffy, 
false teeth.

The false teeth led me 
to the governess;
I now feel inclined to be satisfied with bad 
teeth.

Here another person, 
to whom these features may allude,  
occurs to me.

She is not my patient, 
and I do not wish her to be 
my patient, 
for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with 
me, 
and I do not consider her a docile patient.

She is generally 
pale, 
and once, 
when she had not felt particularly well, 
she was 
puffy.

I have thus compared my patient Irma with two others, 
who would likewise resist treatment.

What is the meaning of the 
fact that I have exchanged her for her friend in the dream? Perhaps that I wish to exchange her;
either her friend arouses in me 
stronger sympathies, 
or I have a higher regard for her intelligence.

For I consider Irma foolish because she does not accept my 
solution.

The other woman would be more sensible, 
and would 
thus be more likely to yield.

The mouth then opens readily;
she 
would tell more than Irma.

What I see in the throat: a white spot and scabby turbinal 
bones.

The white spot recalls diphtheria, 
and thus Irma’s friend, 
but it also recalls the grave illness of my eldest daughter two 
years earlier, 
and all the anxiety of that unhappy time.

The 
scab on the turbinal bones reminds me of my anxiety concerning 
my own health.

At that time I frequently used cocaine in order to 
suppress distressing swellings in the nose, 
and I had heard a few 
days previously that a lady patient who did likewise had
contracted an extensive
necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane.

In 1885 it was I who had recommended the use of cocaine, 
and I 
had been gravely reproached in consequence.

A dear friend, 
who had died before the date of this dream, 
had hastened his end by 
the misuse of this remedy.
 
I quickly call Dr M, 
who refeats the examination.

This would 
simply correspond to the position which M occupied among us.
 
But the word quickly is striking enough to demand a special 
examination.

It reminds me of a sad medical experience.

By continually prescribing a drug, 
sulphonal, 
which at that time was 
still considered harmless, 
I was once responsible for a condition 
of acute poisoning in the case of a woman patient, 
and hastily 
turned for assistance to my older and more experienced colleague.

The fact that I really had this case in mind is confirmed by a 
subsidiary circumstance.

The patient, 
who succumbed to the 
toxic effects of the drug, 
bore the same name as my eldest daughter.

I had never thought of this until now;
but now it seems to me 
almost like a retribution of fate — 
as though the substitution of 
persons had to be continued in another sense: this Matilda for 
that Matilda;
an eye for an eye, 
a tooth for a tooth.

It is as 
though I were seeking every opportunity to reproach myself for 
a lack of medical conscientiousness.

Dr M
is pale;
his chin is shaven, 
and he limps.

Of this so 
much is correct, 
that his unhealthy appearance often arouses the 
concern of his friends.

The other two characteristics must belong 
to another person.

An elder brother living abroad occurs to me, 
for he, 
too, 
shaves his chin, 
and if I remember him rightly, 
the M
of the dream bears on the whole a certain resemblance to him.
 
And some days previously the news arrived that he was limping 
on account of an arthritic affection of the hip.

There must be 
some reason why I fuse the two persons into one in my dream.
 
I remember that, 
in fact, 
I was on bad terms with both of them 
for similar reasons.

Both had rejected a certain proposal which 
I had recently made them.
 
My friend Otto is now standing next to the patient, 
and my 
friend Leopold examines her and calls attention to a dulncss low 
down on the left side.

My friend Leopold also is a physician, 
and a relative of Otto’s.

Since the two practise the same speciality, 
fate has made them competitors, 
so that they are constantly 
being compared with one another.

Both of them assisted me for 
years, 
while I was still directing a public clinic for neurotic 
children.

There, 
scenes like that reproduced in my dream had 
often taken place.

While I would be discussing the diagnosis of 
a case with Otto, 
Leopold would examine the child anew and 
make an unexpected contribution towards our decision.

There 
was a difference of character between the two men like that between
Inspector Brasig
and his friend Karl.

Otto was remarkably 
prompt and alert;
Leopold was slow and thoughtful, 
but thorough.

If I contrast Otto and the cautious Leopold in the dream 
I do so, 
apparently, 
in order to extol Leopold.

The comparison 
is like that made above between the disobedient patient Irma 
and her friend, 
who was believed to be more sensible.

I now become aware of one of the tracks along which the association of 
ideas in the dream proceeds: from the sick child to the children’s 
clinic.

Concerning the dulness low on the left side, 
I have the 
impression that it corresponds with a certain case of which all the 
details were similar, 
a case in which Leopold impressed me by his 
thoroughness.

I thought vaguely, 
too, 
of something like a metastatic affection, 
but it might also be a reference to the patient 
whom I should have liked to have in Irma’s place.

For this lady, 
as far as I can gather, 
exhibited symptoms which imitated tuberculosis. 

An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder.

I know at 
once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, 
which I 
always feel if I lie awake long at night.

The very phrasing of the 
dream sounds ambiguous: Something which I can feel, 
as he does, 
in spite of the dress.

Feel on my own body is intended.
 
Further, 
it occurs to me how unusual the phrase infiltrated portion of skin sounds.

We are accustomed to the phrase: an infiltration 
of the upper posterior left;
this would refer to the 
lungs, 
and thus, 
once more, 
to tuberculosis.
 
In spite of the dress.

This, 
to be sure, 
is only an interpolation.
 
At the clinic the children were, 
of course, 
examined undressed;
here we have some contrast to the manner in which adult female 
patients have to be examined.

The story used to be told of an 
eminent physician that he always examined his patients through 
their clothes.

The rest is obscure to me;
I have, 
frankly, 
no 
inclination to follow the matter further.
 
Dr M says: 
It’s an infection, 
but it doesn’t matter;
dysentery will follow, 
and the poison wiU be eliminated 
This, 
at first,  
seems to me ridiculous;
nevertheless, 
like everything else, 
it 
must be carefully analysed;
more closely observd it seems after 
all to have a sort of meaning.

What I had found in the patient 
was a local diphtheritis.

I remember the discussion about diphtheritis and diphtheria
at the time of my daughter’s illness.
 
Diphtheria is the general infection which proceeds from local 
diphtheritis.

Leopold demonstrates the existence of such a 
general infection by the dulness, 
which also suggests a metastatic 
focus.

I believe, 
however, 
that just this kind of metastasis does 
not occur in the case of diphtheria.

It reminds me rather of 
pyaemia.
 
It doesn’t matter is a consolation.

I believe it fits in as follows: The last part of the dream has yielded a content to the 
effect that the patient’s sufferings are the result of a serious organic affection.

I begin to suspect that by this I am only trying 
to shift the blame from myself.

Psychic treatment cannot be 
held responsible for the continued presence of a diphtheritic 
affection.

Now, 
indeed, 
I am distressed by the thought of having 
invented such a serious illness for Irma, 
for the sole purpose of 
exculpating myself.

It seems so cruel.

Accordingly, 
I need the 
assurance that the outcome will be benign, 
and it seems to me 
that I made a good choice when I put the words that consoled me 
into the mouth of Dr M, 
But here I am placing myself in a 
position of superiority to the dream;
a fact which needs explanation. 

But why is this consolation so nonsensical? 
Dysentery.

Some sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that the 
toxins of disease might be eliminated through the intestines.

Am I thereby trying to make fun of Dr M’s
remarkable store of 
far-fetched explanations, 
his habit of conceiving curious pathological relations? Dysentery suggests something else.

A few 
months ago I had in my care a young man who was suffering 
from remarkable intestinal troubles;
a case which had been 
treated by other colleagues as one of anaemia with malnutrition.

I realized that it was a case of hysteria;
I was unwilling 
to use my psychotherapy on him, 
and sent him off on a seavoyage.

Now a few days previously I had received a despairing 
letter from him;
he wrote from Egypt, 
saying that he had had a 
fresh attack, 
which the doctor had declared to be dysentery.

I suspect that the diagnosis is merely an error on the part of an 
ignorant colleague, 
who is allowing himself to be fooled by the 
hysteria;
yet I cannot help reproaching myself for putting the 
invalid in a position where he might contract
some organic affection of the bowels
in addition to his hysteria.

Furthermore, 
dysentery sounds not unlike diphtheria, 
a word which does not 
occur in the dream.
 
Yes, 
it must be the case that with the consoling prognosis,  
Dysentery will develop, 
etc.
 
I am making fun of Dr M, 
for 
I recollect that years ago he once jestingly told a very similar 
story of a colleague.

He had been called in to consult with him 
in the case of a woman who was very seriously ill, 
and he felt 
obliged to confront his colleague, 
who seemed very hopeful, 
with 
the fact that he found albumen in the patient’s urine.

His colleague, 
however, 
did not allow this to worry him, 
but answered 
calmly: That does not matter, 
my dear sir;
the albumen will 
soon be excreted! Thus I can no longer doubt that this part of 
the dream expresses derision for those of my colleagues who are 
ignorant of hysteria.

And, 
as though in confirmation, 
the thought 
enters my mind: Does Dr M
know that the appearances in 
Irma’s friend, 
his patient, 
which gave him reason to fear tuberculosis, 
are likewise due to hysteria? Has he recognized this 
hysteria, 
or has he allowed himself to be fooled? 

But what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? 
That is simple enough: Dr M 
agrees with my solution as little 
as does Irma herself.

Thus, 
in this dream I have already revenged 
myself on two persons: on Irma in the words, 
If you still have 
pains, 
it is your own fault, 
and on Dr M
in the wording of 
the nonsensical consolation which has been put into his mouth. 

We know precisely how the infection originated.

This precise 
knowledge in the dream is remarkable.

Only a moment before 
this we did not yet know of the infection, 
since it was first demonstrated by Leopold.
 
My friend Otto gave her an infection not long ago, 
when she 
was feeling unwell.

Otto had actually related during his short 
visit to Irma’s family that he had been called in to a neighbouring 
hotel in order to give an injection to someone who had been 
suddenly taken ill.

Injections remind me once more of the unfortunate friend who poisoned himself with cocaine.

I had recommended the remedy for internal use only during the withdrawal 
of morphia;

but he immediately gave himself injections of 
cocaine.
 
With a preparation of propyl, 
propyls, 
propionic acid,  
How on earth did this occur to me? On the evening of the day 
after I had written the clinical history and dreamed about the 
case, 
my wife opened a bottle of liqueur labelled Ananas, 
which was a present from our friend, 
Otto.

He had, 
as a matter of 
fact, 
a habit of making presents on every possible occasion;
I 
hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife.
This liqueur 
smelt so strongly of fusel oil that I refused to drink it.

My wife 
suggested: We will give the bottle to the servants, 
and I, 
more 
prudent, 
objected, 
with the philanthropic remark: They shan’t 
be poisoned either.

The smell of fusel oil, 
amyl, 
has now 
apparently awakened my memory of the whole series: propyl,  
methyl, 
etc.
 
which furnished the preparation of propyl mentioned in the dream. 

Here, 
indeed, 
I have effected a substitution: 
I dreamt of propyl after smelling amyl;
but substitutions of this 
kind are perhaps permissible, 
especially in organic chemistry.
 
Ananas, 
moreover, 
has a remarkable assonance with the family name 
of my patient Irma.
 
In this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic.

But in another sense 
it proved correct, 
for the unsolved stomach pains, 
for which I did not 
want to be blamed, 
were the forerunners of a serious illness, 
due to gallstones.
 

Trimethylamin.

In the dream I see the chemical formula of 
this substance — which at all events is evidence of a great effort on 
the part of my memory — and the formula is even printed in 
heavy type, 
as though to distinguish it from the context as 
something of particular importance.

And where does trimethylamin, 
thus forced on my attention, 
lead me? To a conversation 
with another friend, 
who for years has been familiar with all my 
germinating ideas, 
and I with his.

At that time he had just informed me of certain ideas concerning a sexual chemistry, 
and 
had mentioned, 
among others, 
that he thought he had found in 
trimethylamin one of the products of sexual metabolism.

This 
substance thus leads me to sexuality, 
the factor to which I attribute the greatest significance in respect of the origin of these 
nervous affections which I am trying to cure.

My patient Irma 
is a young widow;
if I am required to excuse my failure to cure 
her, 
I shall perhaps do best to refer to this condition, 
which her 
admirers would be glad to terminate.

But in what a singular 
fashion such a dream is fitted together! The friend who in my 
dream becomes my patient in Irma’s place is likewise a young 
widow.
 
I surmise why it is that the formula of trimethylamin is so insistent in the dream.

So many important things are centred about 
this one word: trimethylamin is an allusion, 
not merely to the 
all-important factor of sexuality, 
but also to a friend whose sympathy I remember with satisfaction whenever I feel isolated in 
my opinions.

And this friend, 
who plays such a large part in my 
life: will he not appear yet again in the concatenation of ideas 
peculiar to this dream? 
Of course;
he has a special knowledge of 
the results of affections of the nose and the sinuses, 
and has 
revealed to science several highly remarkable relations between 
the turbinal bones and the female sexual organs.

The three 
curly formations in Irma’s throat.

I got him to examine Irma, 
in 
order to determine whether her gastric pains were of nasal origin.
 
But he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis, 
which gives me 
concern, 
and to this perhaps there is an allusion in pyaemia, 
 
which hovers before me in the metastasis of the dream. 

One doesn’t give stick injections so rashly.

Here the reproach 
of rashness is hurled directly at my friend Otto.

I believe I had 
some such thought in the afternoon, 
when he seemed to indicate, 
by word and look, 
that he had taken sides against me.

It was, 
perhaps: How easily he is influenced;
how irresponsibly he 
pronounces judgment.

Further, 
the above sentence points once 
more to my deceased friend, 
who so irresponsibly resorted to 
cocaine injections.

As I have said, 
I had not intended that injections of the drug should be taken.
 
I note that in reproaching Otto 
I once more touch upon the story of the unfortunate Matilda, 
which was the pretext for the same reproach against me.

Here,  
obviously, 
I am collecting examples of my conscientiousness,  
and also of the reverse.

Probably too the syringe was not clean. 

Another reproach 
directed at Otto, 
but originating elsewhere.

On the previous day 
I happened to meet the son of an old lady of eighty-two, 
to whom 
I am obliged to give two injections of morphia daily.

At present 
she is in the country, 
and I have heard that she is suffering from 
phlebitis.

I immediately thought that this might be a case of 
infiltration caused by a dirty syringe.

It is my pride that in two 
years I have not given her a single infiltration;
I am always 
careful, 
of course, 
to see that the syringe is perfectly dean.

For 
I am conscientious.

From the phlebitis I return to my wife, 
who 
once suffered from thrombosis during a period of pregnancy, 
and 
now three related situations come to the surface in my memory, 
 
involving my wife, 
Irma, 
and the dead Matilda, 
whose identity 
has apparently justified my putting these three persons in one 
another’s places.
 
I have now completed the interpretation of the dream. 
 
In the 
course of this interpretation I have taken great pains to avoid all 
those notions which must have been suggested by a comparison 
of the dream-content with the dream-thoughts hidden behind 
this content. 

Meanwhile the meaning of the dream has dawned 
upon me. 

I have noted an intention which is realized through 
the dream, 
and which must have been my motive in dreaming. 
 
The dream fulfils several wishes, 
which were awakened within 
me by the events of the previous evening (Otto’s news, 
and the 
writing of the clinical history). 

For the result of the dream is,  
that it is not I who am to blame for the pain which Irma is still 
suffering, 
but that Otto is to blame for it. 

Now Otto has annoyed 
me by his remark about Inna’s imperfect cure;
the dream 
avenges me upon him, 
in that it turns the reproach upon himself. 
 
The dream acquits me of responsibility for Irma’s condition, 
as 
it refers this condition to other causes (which do, 
indeed, 
furnish quite a number of explanations). 

The dream represents a 
certain state of affairs, 
such as I might wish to exist;
the content 
of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish;
its motive is a wish. 
 
This much is apparent at first sight But many other details of 
the dream become intelligible when regarded from the standpoint 
of wish-fulfilment. 

I take my revenge on Otto, 
not merely for 
too readily talcing sides against me, 
in that I accuse him of 
careless medical treatment (the injection), 
but I revenge myself 
also for the bad liqueur which smells of fusel oil, 
and I find an 
expression in the dream which unites both these reproaches: the 
injection of a preparation of propyl. 

Still I am not satisfied, 
but 
continue to avenge myself by comparing him with his more 
reliable colleague. 

Thereby I seem to say: I like him better 
than you. 

But Otto is not the only person who must be made to 
feel the weight of my anger. 

I take my revenge on the disobedient 
patient, 
by exchanging her for a more sensible and more docile 
one. 

Nor do I pass over Dr M’s contradiction;
for I express, 
 
in an obvious allusion, 
my opinion of him: namely, 
that his attitude in this case is that, 
of an ignoramus (Dysentery will develop, 
etc. 

Indeed, 
it seems as though I were appealing from 
him to someone better informed (my friend, 
who told me about 
trimethylamin), 
just as I have turned from Irma to her friend, 
and from Otto to Leopold.
 
It is as though I were to say: Rid me 
of these three persons, 
replace them by three others of my own 
choice, 
and I shall be rid of the reproaches which I am not willing to admit that I deserve! 

In my dream the unreasonableness 
of these reproaches is demonstrated for me in the most elaborate 
manner.

Irma’s pains are not attributable to me, 
since she herself is to blame for them, 
in that she refuses to accept my solution.
They do not concern me, 
for being as they are of an organic 
nature, 
they cannot possibly be cured by psychic treatment.
Irma’s sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her widowhood 
(trimethylamin!);
a state which I cannot alter.

Irma’s illness 
has been caused by an incautious injection administered by Otto,  
an injection of an unsuitable drug, 
such as I should never have 
administered.

Irma’s complaint is the result of an injection 
made with an unclean syringe, 
like the phlebitis of my old lady 
patient, 
whereas my injections have never caused any ill effects.
 
I am aware that these explanations of Irma’s illness, 
which unite 
in acquitting me, 
do not agree with one another;
that they even 
exclude one another.

The whole plea — for this dream is nothing 
else — recalls vividly the defence
offered by a man who
was accused by his neighbour of having returned a kettle in a damaged
condition.

In the first place, 
he said, 
he had returned the kettle 
undamaged;
in the second place it already had holes in it when 
he borrowed it;
and in the third place, 
he had never borrowed it 
at all.

A complicated defence, 
but so much the better;
if only 
one of these three lines of defence is recognized as valid, 
the man 
must be acquitted.
 
Still other themes play a part in the dream, 
and their relation 
to my non-responsibility for Irma’s illness is not so apparent: my 
daughter’s illness, 
and that of a patient with the same name;
the 
harmfulness of cocaine;
the affection of my patient, 
who was 
traveling in Egypt;
concern about the health of my wife;
my 
brother, 
and Dr M; 
my own physical troubles, 
and anxiety 
concerning my absent friend, 
who is suffering from suppurative 
rhinitis.

But if I keep all these things in view, 
they combine into 
a single train of thought, 
which might be labelled: concern for 
the health of myself and others;
professional conscientiousness.
 
I recall a vaguely disagreeable feeling when Otto gave me the 
news of Irma’s condition.

Lastly, 
I am inclined, 
after the event, 
to 
find an expression of this fleeting sensation in the train of 
thoughts which forms part of the dream.

It is as though Otto had 
said to me: You do not take your medical duties seriously 
enough;
you are not conscientious;
you do not perform what 
you promise.

Thereupon this train of thought placed itself at 
my service, 
in order that I might give proof of my extreme conscientiousness, 
of my intimate concern about the health of my 
relatives, 
friends and patients.

Curiously enough, 
there are also 
some painful memories in this material, 
which confirm the blame 
attached to Otto rather than my own exculpation.

The material 
is apparently impartial, 
but the connection between this broader 
material, 
on which the dream is based, 
and the more limited 
theme from which emerges the wish to be innocent of Irma’s 
illness, 
is, 
nevertheless, 
unmistakable.
 
I do not wish to assert that I have entirely revealed the meaning of the dream, 
or that my interpretation is flawless.
 
I could still spend much time upon it;
I could draw further 
explanations from it, 
and discuss further problems which it 
seems to propound.

I can even perceive the points from which 
further mental associations might be traced;
but such considerations as are always involved in every dream of one’s own 
prevent me from interpreting it farther.

Those who are overready to condemn such reserve should make the experiment of 
trying to be more straightforward.

For the present I am content 
with the one fresh discovery which has just been made: If the 
method of dream-interpretation here indicated is followed, 
it 
will be found that dreams do really possess a meaning, 
and are 
by no means the expression of a disintegrated cerebral activity, 
as the writers on the subject would have us believe.

When the 
work of interpretation has been completed the dream can be 
recognized as a wish- fulfilment.
 
When, 
after passing through a narrow defile, 
one suddenly 
reaches a height beyond which the ways part and a rich prospect 
lies outspread in different directions, 
it is well to stop for a 
moment and consider whither one shall turn next.

We are in 
somewhat the same position after we have mastered this first 
interpretation of a dream.

We find ourselves standing in the light 
of a sudden discovery.

The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of a musical instrument, 
which, 
instead of being 
played by the hand of a musician, 
is struck by some external 
force;
the dream is not meaningless, 
not absurd, 
does not presuppose that one part of our store of ideas is dormant while 
another part begins to awake.

It is a perfectly valid psychic 
phenomenon, 
actually a wish-fulfilment;
it may be enrolled in 
the continuity of the intelligible psychic activities of the waking 
state;
it is built up by a highly complicated intellectual activity.
 
But at the very moment when we are about to rejoice in this discovery a host of problems besets us.
If the dream, 
as this theory 
defines it, 
represents a fulfilled wish, 
what is the cause of the 
striking and unfamiliar manner in which this fulfilment is expressed?
What transformation has occurred in our dreamthoughts before the manifest dream,
as we remember it on waking, 
shapes itself out of them? How has this transformation taken 
place? Whence comes the material that is worked up into the 
dream? What causes many of the peculiarities which are to be 
observed in our dream-thoughts;
for example, 
how is it that they 
are able to contradict one another? (see the analogy of the kettle, 
Is the dream capable of teaching us something new concerning our internal psychic processes, 
and can its content correct 
opinions which we have held during the day? I suggest that for 
the present all these problems be laid aside, 
and that a single path 
be pursued.

We have found that the dream represents a wish as 
fulfilled.

Our next purpose should be to ascertain whether this 
is a general characteristic of dreams, 
or whether it is only the 
accidental content of the particular dream (the dream about 
Irma’s injection) with which we have begun our analysis;
for 
even if we conclude that every dream has a meaning and psychic 
value, 
we must nevertheless allow for the possibility that this 
meaning may not be the same in every dream.

The first dream 
which we have considered was the fulfilment of a wish;
another 
may turn out to be the realization of an apprehension;
a third 
may have a reflection as its content;
a fourth may simply reproduce a reminiscence.

Are there, 
then, 
dreams other than wishdreams;
or are there none but wish-dreams? 

It is easy to show that the wish-fulfilment in dreams
is often undisguised and easy to recognize,
so that one may wonder why the 
language of dreams has not long since been understood.

There is,  
for example, 
a dream which I can evoke as often as I please, 
experimentally, 
as it were.

If, 
in the evening, 
I eat anchovies,  
olives, 
or other strongly salted foods, 
I am thirsty at night, 
and 
therefore I wake.

The waking, 
however, 
is preceded by a dream,  
which has always the same content, 
namely, 
that I am drinking.
 
I am drinking long draughts of water;
it tastes as delicious as 
only a cool drink can taste when one’s throat is parched;
and 
then I wake, 
and find that I have an actual desire to drink.

The 
cause of this dream is thirst, 
which I perceive when I wake.

From 
this sensation arises the wish to drink, 
and the dream shows me 
this wish as fulfilled.

It thereby serves a function, 
the nature of 
which I soon surmise.

I sleep well, 
and am not accustomed to 
being waked by a bodily need.

If I succeed in appeasing my 
thirst by means of the dream that I am drinking, 
I need not wake 
up in order to satisfy that thirst.

It is thus a dream of convenience.

The dream takes the place of action, 
as elsewhere in 
life.

Unfortunately, 
the need of water to quench the thirst cannot 
be satisfied by a dream, 
as can my thirst for revenge upon Otto 
and Dr M, 
but the intention is the same.

Not long ago I had 
he same dream in a somewhat modified form.

On this occasion 
I felt thirsty before going to bed, 
and emptied the glass of water 
which stood on the little chest beside my bed.

Some hours later,  
during the night, 
my thirst returned, 
with the consequent discomfort.

In order to obtain water, 
I should have had to get up 
and fetch the glass which stood on my wife’s bed-table.

I thus 
quite appropriately dreamt that my wife was giving me a drink 
from a vase;
this vase was an Etruscan cinerary urn, 
which I 
had brought home from Italy, 
and had since given away.

But 
the water in it tasted so salt (apparently on account of the ashes) 
that I was forced to wake.

It may be observed how conveniently 
the dream is capable of arranging matters.

Since the fulfilment 
of a wish is its only purpose, 
it may be perfectly egoistic.

Love of 
comfort is really not compatible with consideration for others.
 
The introduction of the cinerary urn is probably once again the 
fulfilment of a wish;
I regret that I no longer possess this vase; 
it, 
like the glass of water at my wife’s side, 
is inaccessible to me.
 
The cinerary urn is appropriate also in connection with the 
sensation of an increasingly salty taste, 
which I know will compel me to wake. 

Such convenience-dreams came very frequently to me in my 
youth.

Accustomed as I had always been to working until late 
at night, 
early waiting was always a matter of difficulty.

I used 
then to dream that I was out of bed and standing at the washstand.

After a while I could no longer shut out the knowledge 
that I was not yet up;
but in the meantime I had continued to 
sleep.

The same sort of lethargy-dream was dreamed by a young 
colleague of mine, 
who appears to share my propensity for sleep.
 
With him it assumed a particularly amusing form.

The landlady 
with whom he was lodging in the neighbourhood of the hospital 
had strict orders to wake him every morning at a given hour, 
but 
she found it by no means easy to carry out his orders.

One morning sleep was especially sweet to him.

The woman called into his 
room: Herr Pepi, 
get up;
you’ve got to go to the hospital.
 
Whereupon the sleeper dreamt of a room in the hospital, 
of a bed 
in which he was lying, 
and of a chart pinned over his head, 
which 
read as follows: Pepi M, 
medical student, 
22 years of age.

He 
told himself in the dream: If I am already at the hospital, 
I 
don’t have to go there, 
turned over, 
and slept on.

He had thus 
frankly admitted to himself his motive for dreaming.
 
Here is yet another dream of which the stimulus was active 
during sleep: One of my women patients, 
who had been obliged 
to undergo an unsuccessful operation on the jaw, 
was instructed 
by her physicians to wear by day and night a cooling apparatus 
on the affected cheek;
but she was in the habit of throwing it off 
as soon as she had fallen asleep.

One day I was asked to reprove 
her for doing so;
she had again thrown the apparatus on the 
floor.

The patient defended herself as follows: This time I 
really couldn’t help it;
it was the result of a dream which I had 
during the night.

In the dream I was in a box at the opera, 
and 
was taking a lively interest in the performance.

But Herr Karl 
Meyer was lying in the sanatorium and complaining pitifully on 
account of pains in his jaw.

I said to myself, 
Since I haven’t the 
pains, 
I don’t need the apparatus either’;
that’s why I threw it 
away.

The dream of this poor sufferer reminds me of an expression
which comes to our lips
when we are in a disagreeable situation: Well,
I can imagine more amusing things! The dream 
presents these more amusing things! Herr Karl Meyer, 
to 
whom the dreamer attributed her pains, 
was the most casual 
acquaintance of whom she could think.

It is quite as simple a matter to discover the wish-fulfilment in 
several other dreams which I have collected from healthy persons.

A friend who was acquainted with my theory of dreams, 
and had explained it to his wife, 
said to me one day: My 
wife asked me to tell you that she dreamt yesterday that she 
was having her menses.

You will know what that means.
Of 
course I know: if the young wife dreams that she is having her 
menses, 
the menses have stopped.

I can well imagine that she 
would have liked to enjoy her freedom a little longer, 
before the 
discomforts of maternity began.

It was a clever way of giving 
notice of her first pregnancy.

Another friend writes that his wife 
had dreamt not long ago that she noticed milk-stains on the front 
of her blouse.

This also is an indication of pregnancy, 
but not 
of the first one;
the young mother hoped she would have more 
nourishment for the second child than she had for the first.
 
A young woman who for weeks had been cut off
from all society
because she was nursing a child who was suffering from an
infectious disease dreamt, 
after the child had recovered, 
of a 
company of people in which Alphonse Daudet, 
Paul Bourget,  
Marcel Prevost and others were present;
they were all very 
pleasant to her and amused her enormously.

In her dream these 
different authors had the features which their portraits give 
them.

M Prevost, 
with whose portrait she is not familiar, 
looked 
like the man who had disinfected the sickroom the day before,  
the first outsider to enter it for a long time.

Obviously the dream 
is to be translated thus: It is about time now for something 
more entertaining than this eternal nursing.
 
Perhaps this collection will suffice to prove that frequently, 
and under the most complex conditions, 
dreams may be noted 
which can be understood only as wish-fulfilments, 
and which 
present their content without concealment.

In most cases these 
are short and simple dreams, 
and they stand in pleasant contrast 
to the confused and overloaded dream-compositions which have 
almost exclusively attracted the attention of the writers on the 
subject.

But it will repay us if we give some time to the examination of these simple dreams.
The simplest dreams of all are, 
I suppose, 
to be expected in the case of children whose psychic 
activities are certainly less complicated than those of adults.
 
Child psychology, 
in my opinion, 
is destined to render the same 
services to the psychology of adults as a study of the structure 
or development of the lower animals renders to the investigation 
of the structure of the higher orders of animals.

Hitherto but few 
deliberate efforts have been made to make use of the psychology 
of the child for such a purpose. 

The dreams of little children are often simple fulfilments of 
wishes, 
and for this reason are, 
as compared with the dreams of 
adults, 
by no means interesting.

They present no problem to be 
solved, 
but they are invaluable as affording proof that the dream, 
in its inmost essence, 
is the fulfilment of a wish.

I have been able 
to collect several examples of such dreams from the material 
furnished by my own children.

For two dreams, 
one that of a daughter of mine, 
at that time 
eight and a half years of age, 
and the other that of a boy of five 
and a quarter, 
I am indebted to an excursion to Hallstatt, 
in the 
summer of 1896.

I must first explain that we were living that summer on a hill near Aussee, 
from which, 
when the weather was 
fine, 
we enjoyed a splendid view of the Dachstein.

With a telescope we could easily distinguish the Simony hut.

The children 
often tried to see it through the telescope — I do not know with 
what success.

Before the excursion I had told the children that 
Hallstatt lay at the foot of the Dachstein.

They looked forward 
to the outing with the greatest delight.

From Hallstatt we entered the valley of Eschem, 
which enchanted the children with 
its constantly changing scenery.

One of them, 
however, 
the boy 
of five, 
gradually became discontented.

As often as a mountain 
came into view, 
he would ask: Is that the Dachstein? whereupon I had to reply: No, 
only a foot-hill.

After this question 
had been repeated several times he fell quite silent, 
and did not 
wish to accompany us up the steps leading to the waterfall.

I thought he was tired.

But the next morning he came to me,  
perfectly happy, 
and said: Last night I dreamt that we went 
to the Simony hut.

I understood him now;
he had expected,  
when I spoke of the Dachstein, 
that on our excursion to Hallstatt he would climb the mountain, 
and would see at close 
quarters the hut which had been so often mentioned when the 
telescope was used.

When he learned that he was expected to 
content himself with foot-hills and a waterfall he was disappointed, 
and became discontented.

But the dream compensated 
him for all this.

I tried to learn some details of the dream;
they 
were scanty.

You go up steps for six hours, 
as he had been told. 

On this excursion the girl of eight and a half had likewise 
cherished wishes which had to be satisfied by a dream.

We had 
taken with us to Hallstatt our neighbour’s twelve-year-old boy; 
quite a polished little gentleman, 
who, 
it seemed to me, 
had 
already won the little woman’s sympathies.

Next morning she 
related the following dream: Just think, 
I dreamt that Emil 
was one of the family, 
that he said ‘papa’ and ‘mamma’ to you,  
and slept at our house, 
in the big room, 
like one of the boys.
 
Then mamma came into the room and threw a handful of big 
bars of chocolate, 
wrapped in blue and green paper, 
under our 
beds.

The girl’s brothers, 
who evidently had not inherited an 
understanding of dream-interpretation, 
declared, 
just as the 
writers we have quoted would have done: That dream is nonsense.

The girl defended at least one part of the dream, 
and 
from the standpoint of the theory of the neuroses it is interesting 
to learn which part it was that she defended: That Emil was 
one of the family was nonsense, 
but that part about the bars 
of chocolate wasn’t.

It was just this latter part that was obscure 
to me, 
until my wife furnished the explanation.

On the way home 
from the railway-station the children had stopped in front of a 
slot-machine, 
and had wanted exactly such bars of chocolate,  
wrapped in paper with a metallic lustre, 
such as the machine,  
in their experience, 
provided.

But the mother thought, 
and 
rightly so, 
that the day had brought them enough wish-fulfilments, 
and therefore left this wish to be satisfied in the dream.
 
This little scene had escaped me.

That portion of the dream 
which had been condemned by my daughter I understood without any difficulty.

I myself had heard the well-behaved little 
guest enjoining the children, 
as they were walking ahead of us,  
to wait until ‘papa’ or ‘mamma’ had come up.

For the little girl 
the dream turned this temporary relationship into a permanent 
adoption.

Her affection could not as yet conceive of any other 
way of enjoying her friend’s company permanently than the 
adoption pictured in her dream, 
which was suggested by her 
brothers.

Why the bars of chocolate were thrown under the bed 
could not, 
of course, 
be explained without questioning the child.
 
From a friend I have learned of a dream very much like that 
of my little boy.

It was dreamed by a little girl of eight.

Her 
father, 
accompanied by several children, 
had started on a walk 
to Dornbach, 
with the intention of visiting the Rohrcr hut, 
but 
had turned back, 
as it was growing late, 
promising the children 
to take them some other time.

On the way bade they passed a 
signpost which pointed to the Hameau.

The children now asked 
him to take them to the Hameau, 
but once more, 
and for the 
same reason, 
they had to be content with the promise that they 
should go there some other day.

Next morning the little girl 
went to her father and told him, 
with a satisfied air: Papa, 
I 
dreamed last night that you were with us at the Rohrer hut, 
and 
on the Hameau.

Thus, 
in the dream her impatience had anticipated
the fulfilment of the promise made by her father.
 

Another dream, 
with which the picturesque beauty of the 
Aussee inspired my daughter, 
at that time three and a quarter 
years of age, 
is equally straightforward.
 
The little girl had 
crossed the lake for the first time, 
and the trip had passed too 
quickly for her.

She did not want to leave the boat at the lauding, 
and cried bitterly.

The next morning she told us: Last night 
I was sailing on the lake.

Let us hope that the duration of this 
dream-voyage was more satisfactory to her. 

My eldest boy, 
at that time eight years of age, 
was already 
dreaming of the realization of his fancies.

He had ridden in a 
chariot with Achilles, 
with Diomedes as charioteer.

On the previous day he had shown a lively interest in a book on the myths 
of Greece which had been given to his elder sister.

If it can be admitted that the talking of children in their sleep 
belongs to the sphere of dreams, 
I can relate the following as 
one of the earliest dreams in my collection: My youngest daughter, 
at that time nineteen months old, 
vomited one morning, 
and 
was therefore kept without food all day.

During the night she 
was heard to call excitedly in her sleep: Anna F(r)eud, 
sfawbewy, 
wild st’awbewy, 
om’lette, 
pap l She used her name 
in this way in order to express the act of appropriation;
the 
menu presumably included everything that would seem to her a 
desirable meal;
the fact that two varieties of strawberry appeared in it was a demonstration against the sanitary regulations 
of the household, 
and was based on the circumstance, 
which she 
had by no means overlooked, 
that the nurse had ascribed her 
indisposition to an over-plentiful consumption of strawberries;
 
so in her dream she avenged herself for this opinion which met 
with her disapproval.

When we call childhood happy because it does not yet know 
sexual desire, 
we must not forget what a fruitful source of disappointment and renunciation, 
and therefore of dream-stimulation, 
the other great vital impulse may be for the child.

Here is 
a second example.

My nephew, 
twenty-two months of age, 
had 
been instructed to congratulate me on my birthday, 
and to give 
me a present of a small basket of cherries, 
which at that time of 
the year were scarce, 
being hardly in season.

He seemed to find 
the task a difficult one, 
for he repeated again and again: Cherries in it, 
and could not be induced to let the little basket go out 
of his hands.

But he knew how to indemnify himself.
He had, 
until then, 
been in the habit of telling his mother every morning 
that he had dreamt of the white soldier, 
an officer of the guard 
in a white cloak, 
whom he had once admired in the street.

On 
the day after the sacrifice on my birthday he woke up joyfully 
with the announcement, 
which could have referred only to a 
dream: Herman eaten all the cherries 
What animals dream of I do not know.

A proverb for which 
I am indebted to one of my pupils professes to tell us, 
for it asks 
the question: What does the goose dream of? 
and answers: 
ape may be shown by the examples in my Analyse der Phobic cities jim fjahrigen Knaben,

and Tausk;

Busemann, 
Doglia, 
and especially Wigaiu,  
who emphasizes the wish-fulfilling tendency of such dreams, 
On the other 
hand, 
it seems that dreams of an infantile type reappear with especial frequency
in adults who are transferred
into the midst of unfamiliar conditions.
Thus Otto Nordcnskjold, 
in his book, 
Antarctic (1904, 
vol,
i,  
writes as follows of the crew who spent the winter with him;
Very characteristic of the trend of our inmost thoughts were our dreams, 
which were 
never more vivid and more numerous.

Even those of our comrades with 
whom dreaming was formerly exceptional had long stories to tell in the 
morning, 
when we exchanged our experiences in the world of phantasy.
 
They all had reference to that outside world which was now so far removed 
from us, 
but they often fitted into our immediate circumstances.
An especially characteristic dream was that in which one of our comrades believed 
himself back at school, 
where the task was assigned to him of skinning 
miniature seals, 
which were manufactured especially for purposes of instruction.

Eating and drinking constituted the pivot around which most of 
our dreams revolved.

One of us, 
who was especially fond of going to big 
dinner-parties, 
was delighted if he could report in the morning ‘that he had 
had a three-course dinner.

Another dreamed of tobacco, 
whole mountains 
of tobacco;
yet another dreamed of a ship approaching on the open sea 
under full sail.

Still another dream deserves to be mentioned;
The postman 
brought the post and gave a long explanation of why it was so long delayed;
he had delivered it at the wrong address, 
and only with great trouble 
was he able to get it back.

To be sure, 
we were often occupied in our sleep 
with still more impossible things, 
but the lack of phantasy in almost all the 
dreams which I myself dreamed, 
or heard others relate, 
was quite striking.

It would certainly have been of great psychological interest if all 
these dreams could have been recorded.

But one can readily understand 
how we longed for sleep.

That alone could afford us everything that we all 
most ardently desired.

I will continue by a quotation from Du Prel (p. 
231) : Mungo Park, 
nearly dying of thirst on one of his African expeditions, 
dreamed constantly of the well-watered valleys and meadows of his 
home.

Similarly Trenck, 
tortured by hunger in the fortress of Magdeburg, 
saw himself surrounded by copious meals.
And George Back, 
a member of 
Franklin’s first expedition, 
when he was on the point of death by starvation, 
dreamed continually and invariably of plenteous meals.
 
Of maize.

The whole theory that the dream is the fulfilment of 
a wish is contained in these two sentences. 

We now perceive that we should have reached our theory of 
the hidden meaning of dreams by the shortest route had we 
merely consulted the vernacular.
Proverbial wisdom, 
it is true,  
often speaks contemptuously enough of dreams — it apparently 
seeks to justify the scientists when it says that dreams are bubbles;
but in colloquial language the dream is predominantly 
the gracious fulfiller of wishes.

I should never have imagined 
that in my wildest dreams, 
we exclaim in delight if we find that 
the reality surpasses our expectations.
