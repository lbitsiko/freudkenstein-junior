* A *quite bad* AI writer who read "The Interpretation of Dreams" by S. Freud yet speaks like Frankenstein's monster.

* A creative coding idea in order to create a textual art. 

* Random walk code, some input and output data as well as some indesign stuff presented here.

* Initial inspiration (in short): The digital space creates an alternate reality co-existing with our perceived version of physical reality much like dreams. A redefinition of the Digital is happening as it becomes more and more perplexed and co-dependent with the Physical forming a new identity, the Phygital. Through a digital writer who read Freud one might have access to the Digital's subconsious.
